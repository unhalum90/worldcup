# 🌎 World Cup Travel Brain – Integrated Project Plan
*(Final Consolidated Version – October 2025)*

---

## 🧭 Project Summary

**Goal:**  
Build an AI-driven, multilingual travel assistant that helps fans plan their entire 2026 World Cup journey — from international flights and intercity travel to lodging zones and local match-day logistics.

**Core Vision:**  
Create a seamless “Fan Travel Brain” consisting of three intelligent modules (Brains):  
1. ✈️ **Flight Brain** – routes, connections, and transit logic  
2. 🏨 **Lodging Brain** – where to stay and why  
3. ⚽ **Local Brain** – what to know once there  

All powered by a shared Supabase schema, Google Gemini for real-time travel reasoning, and GPT‑5 for narrative output, localization, and presentation.

# 🏗️ System Overview

### Primary User Feature
**World Cup Trip Travel Overview**  
> “Plan your complete World Cup journey — flights, lodging, and logistics in one simple view.”

Users can start with a fast, one-form overview or dive deeper into the three specialized Brains.

### User Flow
```
Landing Page
 ├── World Cup Trip Travel Overview (Quick Planner)
 ├── Flight Brain
 ├── Lodging Brain
 └── Local Brain (Coming May 2026)
```

Each Brain connects to the same Supabase backend but provides a different layer of intelligence.

# ✈️ Flight Brain

**Purpose:**  
Handle flight and intercity routing, identifying efficient travel paths between host cities or strategic hubs.

**Key Features:**
- Gemini + Google Travel connectors for flights, trains, and driving routes.  
- Detects major hubs (e.g., Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta) and can suggest indirect routes:  
  > “Fly Oslo → Chicago, then take a 7‑hour train to Kansas City.”  
- Returns travel duration, cost bands, and route recommendations.

**Database Integration:**
- References `cities` and new `matches` table for match locations and dates.  
- Adds field `is_hub` to `cities` for routing logic.

**Output Example:**
> “Fly Oslo → Miami (9 h); Miami → Atlanta (2 h); Atlanta → Philadelphia (2 h). Total travel 13 h, 3 legs.”

---

# 🏨 Lodging Brain

**Purpose:**  
Recommend lodging zones per city based on distance to stadiums, fan fests, and transit quality — without relying on live hotel pricing.

**Core Concept:**  
> “If you stay here, this is how long it’ll take to reach the stadium or fan fest — and what kind of fan experience to expect.”

**Data Focus:** Spatial reasoning and commute intelligence.

**Database Tables:**

### Table: `cities`
| Field | Type | Example |
|--------|------|----------|
| id | uuid | — |
| city_name | text | Dallas |
| stadium_name | text | AT&T Stadium |
| stadium_lat | float | 32.7473 |
| stadium_long | float | -97.0945 |
| fan_fest_location | text | Fair Park |
| fan_fest_lat | float | 32.7769 |
| fan_fest_long | float | -96.7677 |
| is_hub | boolean | TRUE |

### Table: `zones`
| Field | Type | Example | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| id | uuid | — | PK |
| city_name | text | Dallas | |
| zone_name | text | Fort Worth | |
| lat | float | 32.7555 | |
| long | float | -97.3308 | |
| drive_time_to_stadium | int | 45 | minutes |
| public_time_to_stadium | int | 90 | minutes |
| drive_time_to_fanfest | int | 60 | minutes |
| public_time_to_fanfest | int | 80 | minutes |
| transit_quality | int | 1–10 | |
| hotel_density | int | 54 | count of hotels |
| tag | text | “budget” | |
| notes | text | “Good restaurants, long commute” | |

**Automation via Make.com:**
1. Monthly trigger → fetch zones  
2. Google Directions API → travel times (car + transit)  
3. Google Places API → hotel density count  
4. Update Supabase

**Output Example:**
> “Stay in Irving for balanced access: 35 min drive to AT&T Stadium, 45 min to Fan Fest via DART. Fort Worth saves money but adds 90 min commute.”

---

# ⚽ Local Brain (Coming May 2026)

**Purpose:**  
Provide match‑day and local intelligence: transportation, fan fests, dining, nightlife, and safety.

**Data Sources:**  
- Manual entries + local tourism APIs  
- Crowdsourced updates (“Fan Check‑ins”)  
- Integration with official FIFA event calendars

**Output Example:**  
> “Fan Fest at Centennial Park, live music nightly. Marta Line 2 connects directly to Mercedes‑Benz Stadium.”

---

# 🗓️ Match Data Integration

### Table: `matches`
| Field | Type | Example | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| id | uuid | — | PK |
| date | date | 2026‑06‑11 | |
| city_id | uuid | — | FK |
| stadium_name | text | AT&T Stadium | |
| group_name | text | Group F | |
| match_number | int | 11 | |
| home_team | text | Norway | |
| away_team | text | Argentina | |
| kickoff_local | time | 20:00 | |
| notes | text | “Opening match in Arlington” | |

**Functionality:**
- User selects **team** → app auto‑retrieves match schedule and cities.  
- **Flight Brain** generates routing order chronologically.  
- **Lodging Brain** proposes stay durations per city.  
- **Local Brain** shows events & transport options for each date.

# 🌍 Localization Strategy

**Languages:** English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Arabic (German/Italian optional Q2 2026)

**Implementation:**
- `/en/`, `/es/`, `/fr/`, `/pt/`, `/ar/` sub‑paths.  
- GPT handles multilingual output dynamically via `Respond in ${userLanguage}` system message.  
- Static translated SEO pages per city for search indexing.

**Example (Spanish):**
> 🇪🇸 *Dónde alojarte para el Mundial 2026 – Dallas / Fort Worth*  
> Si te alojas en **Fort Worth**, ahorrarás unos 75 $ por noche, pero el trayecto al estadio AT&T puede superar los 90 min en transporte público.

# 🧭 Data‑Driven Travel Logic

### Example: Chicago as a Strategic Hub
Chicago hosts no games but acts as a **major air‑travel hub**.  
Gemini can detect scenarios like:
> “Fly Oslo → Chicago (direct, 8 h), then take 7‑hour Amtrak to Kansas City — saves 2 h + $180 pp.”

Implementation:
- Add `is_hub` flag to `cities`.  
- Gemini prioritizes hub routing when optimizing travel.
