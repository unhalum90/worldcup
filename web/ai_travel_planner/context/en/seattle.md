# World Cup 2026 Seattle: Travel & Logistics Guide

Your Phase 1 Travel Guide: Navigating the 2026 World Cup in Seattle
Welcome to the Emerald City, a premier host for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and a destination where the roar of the crowd is matched only by the beauty of the landscape. This expertly designed "Phase 1" guide provides a comprehensive logistical framework for international and domestic fans planning their journey. Our focus is to empower you to make critical decisions—flights, lodging, and local transportation—well in advance of the June-July 2026 tournament. In an event of this magnitude, early and strategic planning is not just an advantage; it is the key to a seamless, enjoyable, and unforgettable World Cup experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Executive Overview: Why Early Planning is Non-Negotiable
Securing your travel arrangements for the Seattle World Cup matches requires a proactive and informed approach. This section breaks down the foundational reasons why early planning is essential, providing the strategic "why" behind the detailed advice in this guide. The scale of this event, combined with Seattle's unique characteristics, creates a high-demand environment where foresight is your most valuable asset.
Unprecedented Demand: Seattle will host six matches, including crucial knockout stage games in the Round of 32 and Round of 16. With an estimated 750,000 visitors expected for the tournament, competition for every resource—from hotel rooms to rental cars—will be immense.
Limited Lodging: Accommodations within walking distance of Lumen Field are limited and will be the first to sell out, commanding significant premium rates. Securing lodging early provides the best selection and value.
Complex Transport Network: While Seattle boasts a robust public transit system, its scale can be complex for newcomers. Understanding the network of light rail, buses, and regional trains in advance is crucial for efficient and stress-free travel on match days.
Peak Tourist Season: The tournament coincides with Seattle's popular summer tourist season. This overlap will compound the demand for flights and hotels, leading to sharply inflated prices and limited availability for any last-minute bookings.
With these factors in mind, the first step in building your itinerary is to anchor your plans to the official match schedule.
2. Seattle's 2026 World Cup Match Schedule
Knowing the specific dates of the matches you plan to attend is the anchor for all subsequent logistical planning. These dates will dictate your flight reservations, hotel bookings, and local travel arrangements. Seattle is proud to host the following six matches at Lumen Field:
June 15, 2026: Group Stage Match
June 19, 2026: Group Stage Match (featuring the US Men's National Team)
June 24, 2026: Group Stage Match
June 26, 2026: Group Stage Match
July 1, 2026: Round of 32 Match
July 6, 2026: Round of 16 Match
With these key dates established, you can now move forward with our recommended timeline for securing your travel essentials.
3. Your Strategic Booking Timeline & Checklist
A phased approach to booking removes stress, maximizes your options, and often leads to significant cost savings. The following timeline provides clear, actionable steps to guide you from initial reservations to final pre-travel preparations.
Timeframe
Key Action Items
ASAP
Book refundable flights and hotels to lock in availability. Apply for necessary travel documents, such as a visa or ESTA for international visitors.
60-90 Days Out
Reserve a rental car if your itinerary requires one. Confirm your travel itinerary and prepare copies of all important documents.
30 Days Out
Download essential mobile apps for transit (Sound Transit, King County Metro) and parking (ParkWhiz). Review Lumen Field's clear-bag policy to avoid surprises.

This timeline provides the "when" of your planning process. Next, we will explore the "what," starting with the crucial decision of where to fly.
4. Air Travel Strategy: Choosing Your Arrival Airport
Selecting the right arrival airport is a strategic decision that directly impacts your budget, ground transportation time, and overall travel experience. The Seattle region offers several options that cater to different priorities, from ultimate convenience to significant cost savings.
Regional Airport Analysis
Traveler Profile
Airport (Code)
Analysis & Key Considerations
Premium / Convenience-Focused
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA)
As the primary international hub, SEA is the closest airport to the city (14 mi) and offers the most extensive selection of domestic and international flights. This is the most direct and convenient option for most travelers.
Mid-Range / Balanced
Paine Field (PAE)
Located in Everett (28 mi north), PAE is a smaller, less crowded domestic airport served primarily by Alaska Airlines. It offers a more relaxed arrival experience for those willing to travel slightly further into the city.
Budget / Adventure-Oriented (Option 1)
Bellingham International Airport (BLI)
Situated 90 miles north, BLI may offer cheaper flights. This option requires a scenic 1.5 to 2-hour journey via a comfortable Amtrak Cascades train ride or direct bus service via Greyhound/FlixBus, making it ideal for travelers who want to explore more of the region.
Budget / Adventure-Oriented (Option 2)
Portland International Airport (PDX)
For a two-city experience, fly into PDX in Oregon (175 mi south). As a major international hub, it may offer more competitive flight options and connects to Seattle via a scenic ~3.5-hour Amtrak Cascades train ride, allowing you to explore two iconic Pacific Northwest cities.

Once you have arrived in the Pacific Northwest, the next critical decision is selecting your home base for the tournament.
5. Accommodation Strategy: Where to Stay
Your choice of lodging is more than a place to sleep—it's the home base that dictates your daily commute, budget, and access to the vibrant pulse of Seattle. This guide breaks down the city's neighborhoods and regional alternatives to help you secure the perfect strategic location.

Primary Benefit
Best For
Everett
A quieter, less congested base with good hotel availability just north of the city.
Travelers flying into Paine Field (PAE) or those looking to avoid the central city bustle.
Bellingham
A scenic waterfront base ideal for exploring Northern Washington or even Vancouver, BC, with a direct and picturesque Amtrak train commute to the stadium.
Visitors who want a multi-destination trip or a more relaxed travel experience.
Portland, OR
A vibrant city experience with its own major international airport (PDX) and a scenic train connection to Seattle.
Travelers who want a two-city vacation and plan to use the Amtrak train service between cities.

With your lodging secured, the final piece of the logistical puzzle is planning how to get to the main event: the matches at Lumen Field.
6. Match Day Transportation: Getting to Lumen Field
A well-defined match day transportation plan is critical to a positive World Cup experience. Based on extensive local fan feedback, public transportation is the overwhelmingly preferred method for getting to Lumen Field. The high cost of parking ($50-$70+), severe traffic congestion, and the stadium's excellent transit connectivity make driving a far less attractive option.
Transportation Options Matrix
Mode
Typical Cost (Round-Trip)
Time (One-Way)
Pros & Cons (Analysis)
Link Light Rail
~$5
30-45 min
Pros: Budget-friendly and bypasses all traffic. Park & Ride lots (Angle Lake, Tukwila International Blvd, and Northgate) offer free parking. Cons: Can experience "human Tetris" levels of crowding on major event days, posing challenges for all passengers.
Rental Car / Private Vehicle
$60-$90+ (parking and fuel)
30-60 min
Pros: Complete flexibility for your schedule. Cons: While offering flexibility, local fan consensus overwhelmingly advises against driving due to severe traffic, 'outrageous' parking costs ($50-$70+ near stadium), and the need for a designated driver.
Rideshare (Uber/Lyft)
$50–$100+
30-60 min
Pros: Door-to-door convenience. Cons: Subject to high surge pricing on match days; potential for long waits post-match.
King County Metro Bus
~$5
45-60 min
Pros: Extensive network serving the entire region at a low cost. Cons: Can be slower than light rail and may require multiple transfers.
Amtrak / Inter-City Bus
Varies ($40-$140 round-trip)
1.5-3.5 hours
Pros: The primary mode for those staying in Bellingham or Portland. Seattle's King Street Station is conveniently located adjacent to Lumen Field. Cons: Requires booking in advance.
