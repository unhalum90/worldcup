## Detailed Transportation Analysis

### The "Zapopan Gap" Challenge

Guadalajara faces a critical transportation challenge similar to Dallas's "Arlington Gap." The Estadio Akron is located in **Zapopan**, a northwestern suburb approximately 15-20 kilometers from downtown Guadalajara, with **no direct light rail connection**. The planned Line 5, which would have connected the airport to the stadium, was cancelled and replaced with a BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system.

This means that unlike Mexico City (which has Metro + Tren Ligero to Estadio Azteca), Guadalajara visitors will need to rely on:
- **Bus routes** (various lines, requires local knowledge)
- **Taxis and rideshare** (Uber, Didi) - 20-30 min, $160-200 MXN (~$8-10 USD)
- **Private vehicles** - parking challenges on match days
- **Shuttle buses** - likely to be organized for World Cup

### SITEUR Light Rail System

The existing Guadalajara light rail system (Sistema de Tren Eléctrico Urbano - SITEUR) has three lines but **none serve Estadio Akron directly**:

- **Line 1 (Green)**: Periférico Norte to Periférico Sur (north-south), 20 stations
- **Line 2 (Orange)**: Tetlán to Juárez (east-west), 18 stations  
- **Line 3 (Blue)**: Arcos de Zapopan to Dermatológico (northwest-southeast), 18 stations

**Line 3** passes through Zapopan but does not reach the stadium area. The nearest station is still several kilometers away, requiring a bus transfer or taxi.

### Match Day Transportation Strategy

For World Cup visitors, the recommended strategy will be:
1. **Stay near Centro Histórico** (Fan Festival) and take organized shuttles or taxis to matches
2. **Stay near Zapopan/Stadium** for walking distance access, but sacrifice downtown experience
3. **Rent a car** for flexibility (but parking will be challenging)
4. **Use rideshare** (Uber/Didi) which will likely surge price on match days
