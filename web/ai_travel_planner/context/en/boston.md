# World Cup 2026 Boston: Travel & Logistics Guide

Travel Guide for World Cup 2026 at Gillette Stadium (Boston/Foxborough)
The 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring seven matches (including a quarter-final) to Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts . With Boston expecting huge crowds (World Cup fans and USA’s 250th Independence celebrations), this guide helps international and domestic travelers avoid Boston’s congestion by flying into alternate airports, staying outside the city, and smoothly navigating to Gillette Stadium. We cover alternative airports, transportation options, lodging outside Boston, game-day logistics, and travel tips – all to make your World Cup 2026 trip as convenient as possible.
Alternative Airports (Within 2–3 Hours of Gillette Stadium)
Boston Logan (BOS) is the primary airport for the region, but it will be extremely busy . Consider these alternative airports within a 2–3 hour drive of Gillette Stadium, which may offer cheaper fares, fewer crowds, and easier driving:
Providence – T.F. Green Int’l (PVD) – Distance: ~45 min drive to Gillette . A small international airport in Rhode Island, PVD is only ~20–30 miles (30–45 minutes) from Foxborough . It has over 100 daily flights (about two dozen domestic routes) and a few international connections (to Canada, Ireland, Dominican Republic) . Pros: Much less crowded than Logan, easy in/out, often cheaper parking and rentals  . It’s the official airport of the New England Patriots, and on Patriots game days special MBTA commuter trains run directly from the airport station to Gillette Stadium  – a service likely to be offered for World Cup match days as well (Providence to Foxboro event trains) . Cons: Fewer nonstop long-haul flights; most international travelers will connect via hubs (like NYC or D.C.) to reach PVD.


Hartford – Bradley Int’l (BDL) – Distance: ~2 hours’ drive to Foxborough . Located in Connecticut, BDL is New England’s second-busiest airport with ~7 million passengers/year . It offers nonstop flights to ~24 U.S. cities plus some international (seasonal Cancún and transatlantic flights like Dublin, as well as Toronto/Montreal) . Pros: Smaller and more user-friendly than Logan, with easier parking and driving . Decent flight availability for a regional airport. Cons: Limited nonstop international routes (you might connect in Europe or Canada for transatlantic trips), and no direct public transit to Foxborough, so a rental car is needed .


Manchester-Boston Regional (MHT) – Distance: ~1.5 hours’ drive north of Foxborough. MHT is in southern New Hampshire (~50 miles from Boston) . It’s a smaller regional airport serving under 2 million passengers (as of 2018) . Pros: Very quick and simple airport experience – small terminal and usually short lines. Often used by locals to avoid Logan’s crowds . Cons: Limited flights – primarily domestic flights to major hubs (served by American, Southwest, United) . No direct international flights (you’d connect via another U.S. city) . Also, no direct rail link; you’d likely rent a car to reach Foxborough.


Worcester Regional (ORH) – Distance: ~1 hour drive west of Foxborough (about 50 miles) . A small Massachusetts airport run by Massport, ORH has daily nonstop flights to just a few cities (as of 2025, JetBlue to Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Ft. Myers (seasonal), Delta to New York-LaGuardia, American to Philadelphia)  . These flights allow connections onward to many destinations (e.g. via NYC or Philly) . Pros: Very convenient and uncrowded; easy parking and short security lines. Sometimes good fares to Florida or NYC. Cons: No direct international service . Extremely limited flight schedule and airlines – you may have to plan around only one or two flights per day on certain routes. Best for travelers who can connect through those hubs, or locals within driving distance. Rental cars are available but in limited supply.


Albany International (ALB) – Distance: ~2.5–3 hours’ drive (about 170 miles) to Foxborough  . Located in upstate New York, ALB is a mid-sized airport with service from ~8 airlines. It has nonstop flights to ~27 domestic destinations (major hubs like Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, DC, etc.) . Pros: Less busy than big hubs, and you might find cheaper domestic flights or last-minute availability here if Boston/PVD are sold out. Easy rental car process and quick access to I-90 highway for the drive east. Cons: No nonstop long-haul flights – virtually all international travelers would have to connect from elsewhere. The ~3 hour drive to Foxborough is on the longer side, so only consider Albany if you plan a New England road trip or cannot find other options. No direct public transit to Massachusetts from ALB (though Amtrak runs from Albany to Boston if one prefers train over driving).


Other options slightly beyond 3 hours include New York City’s airports (JFK, EWR, LGA) – around 4 hours’ drive – which have the most international flights. Some fans may fly into NYC for other matches and drive up to Boston/Foxborough . If you do this, plan for heavy traffic on the I-95 corridor. In general, flying to a smaller New England airport can save headaches: you’ll avoid Logan’s crowds and likely have an easier drive and cheaper hotels/car rentals .

Why avoid Boston Logan? Logan is one of the busiest U.S. airports, with 40+ airlines and 100+ nonstop destinations . During the World Cup and July 4th, it will be extremely busy. The smaller regional airports above can offer shorter lines and simpler navigation – a big relief after a long flight. Once you arrive at these airports, you can pick up a rental car or hop on a train (from PVD) to reach the Foxborough area without ever dealing with downtown Boston traffic.
Transportation Options to Gillette Stadium
Once you’re on the ground in New England, you’ll need to plan how to get to Gillette Stadium for match days. Foxborough is a suburban town about 30 miles southwest of Boston, and the stadium is not in a major city center – it’s accessible by highways and special event transit, but not by everyday urban transit lines . Here are your main options:
Rental Car / Driving: For many travelers, renting a car will be the most flexible option to move between airport, hotel, and stadium. The USA is very car-centric , and having a car lets you explore New England beyond just the matches. Pros: You control your schedule; can stay in a distant town and still get to the game; useful if you’re visiting other cities/attractions. Cons: Boston-area driving can be tricky (lots of traffic, confusing road layouts) , and rental prices will surge around the World Cup . If you need a car, book as early as possible to lock in a better rate . Remember to account for parking costs at hotels and the stadium. Tip: try to get a GPS or use a navigation app, and consider renting outside major cities to save money.


Public Transportation (Rail & Bus): On World Cup match days, MBTA Commuter Rail will run special “Foxboro Event” trains directly to Gillette Stadium . This is a hassle-free way to avoid driving. Trains will originate from Boston’s South Station and from Providence Station, going to the Foxboro station which is right at the stadium (8-minute walk) . These special trains typically arrive about 30 minutes before kickoff and depart ~30 minutes after the final whistle . Round-trip fare is around $20 (buy tickets in advance, as they can sell out) . Outside of these event trains, Foxboro station has limited service – the regular Franklin Line doesn’t serve all events  – so assume you must take the designated event train if you want to ride rail to a match. If you’re staying in Boston or Providence, this is ideal: you can take a train from downtown to the stadium and skip parking altogether.


Intercity Trains: Amtrak’s Northeast Regional and Acela trains connect many East Coast cities. For example, if you fly into New York or D.C., you could train to Providence and then drive or take a commuter train to Foxborough. There’s also an Amtrak line from Albany, NY to Boston. However, these won’t directly get you to Gillette Stadium – you’d use them to reach Boston/Providence then use other means.


Buses: Regional coach buses (Greyhound, Peter Pan, etc.) can get you to Boston or Providence from other cities. But again, no scheduled bus goes straight to Gillette on game day. Instead, look for private shuttles: for World Cup 2026, companies like Boston Common Coach and Rally are planning ticketed coach buses from various towns in the region to Gillette Stadium . For example, Boston Common Coach will run luxury buses from Boston and some suburbs (like Peabody on the North Shore) directly to the stadium, with options to tailgate on-site  . These buses require advance booking but let you “park and ride” – a good choice if you don’t want to drive. Check World Cup transport forums or sites for up-to-date shuttle services as 2026 approaches.


Rideshare (Uber/Lyft): Using a rideshare or taxi is another option, especially if you’re in a nearby town. Uber and Lyft are ubiquitous in Massachusetts . From Providence to Foxborough, an Uber might cost around $50–$80 one-way (estimate), and from a closer town like Norwood maybe $25. Pros: You don’t have to drive or park, and you can depart on your own schedule. Cons: On game days, demand will be very high – expect surge pricing and long wait times after the match. Gillette Stadium has a designated rideshare pick-up/drop-off area in Lot 15 (near the Bass Pro Shops) . All Uber/Lyft pickups must funnel through that lot, which can get congested. If using rideshare, arrive early (drivers can drop you near the stadium easily before traffic builds) and after the game be prepared to wait (or consider walking a bit away from the stadium to meet your driver once they get past the traffic zone). It’s recommended to coordinate a specific pickup location via the app’s communication feature and follow police/staff directions at the venue.


Tips for Driving to Gillette: If you drive, plan your route and timing carefully. Route 1, the main road past the stadium, experiences heavy traffic on match days – locals know that backups on Route 1 before and after games are inevitable . To avoid the worst jams, arrive at least 2–3 hours before kickoff (gates open early and there’s plenty to do at Patriot Place – see Game Day Logistics). Use navigation apps (Google Maps or Waze) to monitor real-time traffic and consider alternate approaches: for example, from the south via I-495 to US-1 North, or from the north via I-95 to US-1 South. Both will be busy, but staggered arrival helps. Parking is well-organized (more on that below), but exiting will be slow – accept that it might take an hour to get out of the lots if you leave right after the game. Some drivers hang out for a while post-game (or use the “delayed exit” lots) to let traffic dissipate. Also note: Massachusetts has all-electronic tolling, so if your route takes you on the Mass Pike (I-90) or certain Boston-area tunnels, you’ll need an E-ZPass transponder or you’ll be billed by plate . Make sure your rental car has a toll solution or plan a toll-free route.
Where to Stay Instead of Boston
Boston’s hotels will be in high demand (and at premium prices) during summer 2026. To save money and avoid city crowds, many fans are looking at alternative cities and suburbs to stay, all within an hour or so of Gillette Stadium. Below are some recommended areas to consider, with typical accommodations at different budget levels. These locations offer sufficient hotels, easier driving, and in some cases public transit access – great for travelers who want to experience New England beyond the Boston metro while still being close to the action.
1. Providence, Rhode Island: This small but vibrant city is only ~20–30 miles from Foxborough (30-40 minutes by car) , straight up I-95. It’s an excellent Boston alternative: more affordable (hotels and restaurants are cheaper than Boston ) and large enough to have plenty to do (waterfront dining, historic neighborhoods, pubs, etc.). Accommodation: Providence has everything from budget motels (in nearby Warwick by the airport) to mid-range hotels (e.g. Hilton Providence, Marriott) and a few upscale hotels like the Omni Providence or Graduate Providence in a historic building. You could pay under $150 at a basic hotel or around $250–$300 at a top-end property – still likely less than downtown Boston rates during the World Cup. Transit: Providence is a fantastic base if you want to use public transport – the MBTA special event train will run from Providence Station directly to Gillette Stadium on match days . If you prefer to drive, it’s an easy half-hour highway drive (you can also approach via back roads through Wrentham to avoid some traffic). Providence’s T.F. Green Airport (PVD) is right there, making it convenient for those flying in that way. The city is gearing up for visitors and “wants to welcome you” – they consider Gillette in their backyard – so you’ll find local hospitality and possibly special events for fans.
2. Worcester, Massachusetts: Worcester (pronounced “WOO-ster”) is about 50 miles west of Foxborough – roughly a 50-minute drive via I-90 (Mass Pike) and I-495 . It’s Massachusetts’ second-largest city, with a downtown revival in recent years. Accommodation: A good selection of mid-range chain hotels (Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Inn, Courtyard, AC Hotel by Marriott) mostly in downtown or near the Worcester Polytechnic Institute area. These often run $150–$250/night. There are also some boutique or higher-end options like the Beechwood Hotel or historical bed-and-breakfasts around. For budget travelers, look just outside Worcester – there are motel-style lodgings in Auburn or Shrewsbury that can be under $100. Pros: Worcester will be far less impacted by World Cup crowds, so it’s a “normal” New England city experience. You’ll also be west of Boston, which could be useful if you’re also heading to matches in New York or wanting to explore countryside (e.g. Sturbridge Village, etc.). Cons: No direct public transit to Foxborough – you will need to drive. However, the highways from Worcester to Foxborough are usually not too congested except possibly near the stadium exit on game day.
3. Foxborough Area (Patriot Place, Walpole, Norwood): For maximum convenience, you can stay right near Gillette Stadium or in neighboring towns. Foxborough itself is small, but Gillette Stadium has two on-site hotels at Patriot Place: the Renaissance Boston Patriot Place Hotel (a full-service upscale hotel) and a Hilton Garden Inn – both literally a few minutes’ walk from the stadium . Note: These will be costly on game nights (prices likely to spike well above $300). However, many fans feel the convenience is worth it: “game nights come at a costly premium… absolutely worth it” to wake up next to the stadium and enjoy the pre-game atmosphere at Patriot Place . If those are out of budget or booked, look in nearby towns like Walpole, Mansfield, Sharon, Norwood, Franklin, etc. For example, Walpole/Norwood (10–15 miles north) along Route 1 and I-95 have several hotels: a reasonably priced Home2 Suites by Hilton in Walpole (often ~$150/night, 2.5 miles from Gillette ), Courtyard by Marriott and Four Points by Sheraton in Norwood, etc. To the south, Mansfield/Foxborough at I-95 (exit 7) has a cluster of hotels – e.g. Hampton Inn & Suites Foxborough (about 6.5 miles, usually mid-range cost) , Residence Inn, Red Roof Inn (budget) – which are popular for Patriots games. These suburban hotels typically offer free parking and easier last-mile driving. Transit: Some of these towns are on MBTA commuter rail lines (for instance, Mansfield is on the Providence line, and Norwood on a different line), but on game day you’d still need a car or shuttle to reach the stadium from the hotel. If you stay at Patriot Place itself, you obviously can walk to the stadium in minutes. Otherwise, a short Uber from a Walpole/Norwood hotel is feasible.
4. Plymouth and South Shore, MA: Plymouth – known as “America’s Hometown” for its Pilgrim history – is less than an hour’s drive to Foxborough (roughly 40–45 miles) , and also about an hour to Boston. This coastal town in the South Shore/Cape Cod region is promoting itself as an ideal World Cup base away from the Boston bustle . Accommodation: Plymouth offers a range from charming B&Bs and cozy inns to larger hotels and even luxury resorts. For example, you can find budget motels or family-run inns under $150, mid-range hotels like Hotel 1620 on the waterfront, and Mirbeau Inn & Spa, a luxury resort in Plymouth known for its spa and gardens . Many properties have water views or historic character, since Plymouth is on the ocean. Why Plymouth? If you’d like to combine your trip with sightseeing, Plymouth lets you enjoy beaches, historic sites (like Plimoth Patuxet Museums, the Mayflower II ship, etc.), and even quick trips to Cape Cod. After matches, you can return to a relaxing seaside town instead of a crowded city. Transit: There is no direct public transport from Plymouth to Foxborough; you would drive (take MA-3 to I-495). The upside is you’d approach Gillette from the southeast, possibly avoiding some Boston-area traffic. Just plan around any Cape Cod weekend traffic if your match is near a weekend – summer can be busy heading toward Cape Cod.
5. Southern New Hampshire: Towns in southern New Hampshire (like Nashua, Salem, Manchester) are also options, especially for those flying into Manchester Airport or coming from northern New England. Distance: Nashua is about 70 miles north of Foxborough (~1 hr 15 min drive), Manchester ~65 miles (~1 hr 15 min as well, using I-293/I-93 then I-495 to avoid Boston). Accommodation: These areas have mostly chain hotels (Hampton Inns, Holiday Inns, etc.) at relatively lower prices (since NH has lower taxes). For instance, Manchester has a DoubleTree and Hilton Garden Inn downtown, plus many budget hotels by the highway. Nashua has a mix of mid-range hotels and more basic motels; Salem (NH) has a few as well. Pros: If you’re also doing tourism in NH (hiking, etc.) this could be convenient. Also, no sales tax in NH, so you might save a bit on hotel taxes or any shopping. Cons: You’ll need to drive down to Foxborough, and you will likely have to skirt around Boston’s outskirts. One recommended route is to take I-495 around rather than I-93 straight through Boston. There is no direct train service from NH to the Boston area (commuter rail only goes as far north as Lowell, MA), so a car is a must. This option is best for those with a rental car who don’t mind a longer drive on match day.
6. Rhode Island & SE Massachusetts Suburbs: Aside from Providence, consider suburbs around Providence or in northern Rhode Island/southern Massachusetts. For example, Warwick, RI (near PVD airport) has a cluster of hotels (from budget like La Quinta or Motel 6 to mid-range like Crowne Plaza) often cheaper than city-center hotels – and it’s about a 40-minute drive to Foxborough. Towns like Attleboro, MA or Wrentham, MA (famous for its outlet shopping mall) have a few small inns or limited-service hotels, which put you ~20 minutes from the stadium. If you’re looking for a more resort-like stay, Newport, RI is a beautiful seaside town with many B&Bs and luxury inns – about 60–75 minutes from Foxborough. However, Newport in late June/July is peak tourist season (for beaches and sailing), so expect high prices and minimum stay requirements there. It’s a scenic choice if you want to mix World Cup with New England summer vacation, but not necessarily a budget-friendly or convenient one.
The table below summarizes these recommended lodging areas outside Boston, including distance, typical price range, and transport notes:

Distance to Gillette Stadium (Drive Time)
Typical Lodging Cost Range (USD)
Examples of Accommodation (Budget → Luxury)
Transportation Access to Gillette
Providence, RI
~27 miles south (30–40 min drive)
~$100–$300 (budget to upscale)
E.g. Days Inn Warwick ($100); Hilton Providence ($180); Omni Providence (~$250+)
Direct train on match days (MBTA) ; easy drive via I-95 (30–45 min)
Worcester, MA
~50 miles west (50–60 min)
~$120–$250 (mostly mid-range)
E.g. Quality Inn Auburn ($120); Courtyard Worcester ($180); Beechwood Hotel (~$250)

0–10 miles (0–15 min) – at/near stadium
~$150–$400 (rates spike on game days)
E.g. Red Roof Inn Mansfield ($150); Hilton Garden Inn Patriot Place ($300) ; Renaissance Patriot Place (~$400)
Walkable if at Patriot Place; short drives from Walpole/Norwood hotels; limited local shuttles or Uber
Plymouth, MA (South Shore)
~45 miles southeast (60 min)
~$150–$350 (wide range)
E.g. Blue Spruce Motel ($150); John Carver Inn ($200); Mirbeau Inn & Spa (~$350)
No stadium transit – drive via MA-3 → I-495 (about 1 hour; plan around Cape Cod traffic)
Southern NH (Manchester/Nashua)
~60–70 miles north (75–90 min)
~$100–$250 (generally affordable)
E.g. Motel 6 Nashua ($100); DoubleTree Manchester ($180); Bedford Village Inn (~$250 luxury inn)
No direct transit – drive via I-93 or US-3 → I-495 (skirt Boston’s outskirts; beware rush hour on I-93)
RI/Mass Suburbs (Warwick, Attleboro, etc.)
15–40 miles (20–50 min)
~$100–$200
E.g. La Quinta Warwick ($120); Holiday Inn Mansfield ($180); Henry’s Providence Inn (~$200 B&B)
No direct transit – drive via I-95 or US-1 (approach from south, usually less congested than from Boston)

Note: The above price ranges are estimates (per night) for summer 2026 – actual rates will vary. It’s wise to book accommodations well in advance. Many hotels in these areas can be reserved with free cancellation, so fans have started securing rooms early. Staying outside Boston not only saves money, but you might also enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere. For example, Providence prides itself on being close and welcoming, letting fans “take over the town” without the Boston chaos , and Plymouth offers a picturesque New England summer experience alongside the soccer .
Game Day Logistics at Gillette Stadium
Attending a World Cup match at Gillette Stadium will be thrilling – but planning your game-day logistics is crucial. Below are key tips on parking, transportation, and navigating the stadium on match days (June 10 – July 10, 2026):
Parking Options: Gillette Stadium has ample on-site parking with dozens of lots surrounding the venue. Parking lots will open 4 hours before kickoff for World Cup matches , allowing fans to arrive early, park, and enjoy pre-game festivities. It’s highly recommended to purchase parking passes in advance (likely through the stadium or apps like ParkWhiz) . This guarantees you a spot and speeds up entry. In 2025, Patriots games introduced free general parking with some lots offering a “delayed exit” incentive (75-minute hold back) in exchange for a voucher  – for World Cup, details may differ, but don’t be surprised if certain lots are designated for those willing to stay post-game to ease traffic. Standard parking for a New England Patriots game has been around $40 for a car ; World Cup event rates might be similar or slightly higher. Where to park: If you want a quick getaway after the match and don’t mind a longer walk, consider the lots farther from the stadium entrances (across Route 1) – they may let you hit the road faster. If you want to be closest, the “stadium-side” lots (adjacent to the stadium) are premium and may be reserved for VIP or early purchasers. All official lots are within a 15-minute walk to the gates. There are no sizable off-site park-and-shuttle lots for Gillette; essentially all parking is on the property or immediately adjacent.


Traffic and Congestion: Anticipate significant traffic on all roads leading to the stadium, especially Route 1 which runs along Gillette. Local authorities and stadium officials will manage the flow, but you should plan extra time for both arrival and departure . The worst bottlenecks usually occur in the last 1–2 miles near the stadium exits. If coming from the north (Boston direction) on I-95, traffic may slow from around Exit 19 (old exit 9) onto Route 1. From the south (Providence direction via I-95 or I-495), expect backups approaching US-1 as well. After the game, patience is key – tens of thousands of fans will leave at once, so consider hanging out at Patriot Place for dinner or shopping post-match to let traffic die down. Live traffic apps can help identify if back roads (like Route 140 toward Mansfield, or Route 1A) are moving faster than the main Route 1.


Tailgating: Gillette Stadium has a strong tailgating culture thanks to NFL games, and World Cup match days should be no exception. Tailgating (pre-game parties in the parking lot) is allowed in most parking lots – fans gather to grill food, play music and games, and build up excitement. Lots open 4 hours early specifically to accommodate this . If you have a rental car and the supplies, feel free to join in! Some tips: bring a small charcoal grill or cooler with food/drinks (no open fires); only occupy one parking space; observe any rules provided by staff. It’s a fun way to meet fellow fans – often a mix of Revs (Revolution) supporters and international visitors. If you’re visiting without a car, you can still walk through the lots to soak up the atmosphere – it’s a festival-like vibe. Note: Public consumption of alcohol is technically regulated – stick to your immediate tailgate area, use plastic cups, and be responsible.


Using the Train on Game Day: If you take the MBTA special commuter rail, it will drop you at Foxboro Station, right by the stadium’s Lot 6. From there it’s an easy 5-10 minute walk on a marked path to the stadium gates . Stadium staff and police will be on hand to direct the walking crowd. After the match, trains typically depart ~30 minutes after the final whistle – head straight back to the station to catch your train (don’t linger too long or you’ll miss it). The train avoids traffic but remember you’ll be on a fixed schedule. Also, buy your round-trip train tickets in advance (via the MBTA mTicket app or at the station if available) because the lines can be long on game day and conductors may not sell onboard if they’re busy.


Shuttles and Drop-offs: Some hotels or private groups may organize shuttles to the stadium – for instance, a hotel in Providence or Mansfield might offer a minibus for guests. Check with your accommodation. If you get dropped off by Uber/taxi or a friend, the driver will be directed to the rideshare drop-off zone (Lot 15)  or another designated area away from the immediate stadium front. Coordinate a pickup spot for after the game – note that post-game pickups will also be at Lot 15 for Uber/Lyft, and there will be a queue. Traditional taxis may stage near Lot 15 as well. It might help to walk a short distance (maybe to a landmark like Bass Pro Shops or a lot across Route 1) for easier pickup once crowds disperse.


Stadium Entry & Security: Expect airport-style security screening at the stadium. FIFA will have a bag policy – likely only small clear bags or none at all (Gillette’s usual NFL bag policy allows clear bags up to 12”x6”x12”). Check the FIFA 2026 website closer to the event for specific guidelines. Gates will open at least 2 hours before kickoff. There are multiple gates around the stadium; your ticket will specify the recommended entry. If you arrive early, lines will be shorter and you can enjoy amenities inside (food, merchandise, fan activations). There might also be a Fan Fest in Boston on other days , but on match day, the focus is on getting to Foxborough.


Facilities and Navigation: Gillette Stadium is a modern facility with ample concessions, restrooms, and staff to help. It seats ~65,000 for World Cup soccer . The sections are clearly numbered, and digital signage plus volunteers (and likely multi-lingual signage for World Cup) will assist fans. Cellular service can get bogged down with a full crowd, so download any tickets or maps in advance. Wi-Fi might be available (Gillette has it for Patriots games via a free network). If you drive, note your parking lot name/number and perhaps pin it on your phone map so you don’t get lost in the sea of cars after the game!


Post-Game: As mentioned, traffic leaving will be slow. This is a great time to relax at Patriot Place – the shopping/dining complex adjacent to the stadium. There are restaurants (from fast food to sit-down eateries like CBS Sporting Club, Tavolino pizza, etc.), bars, and even a museum (Patriots Hall of Fame). After a big game, these venues often stay open later. Even grabbing a snack and hanging out for 45-60 minutes can make your drive back much easier. If you parked in a “Delayed Release” lot (if offered) where you’re not allowed to leave for 75 minutes, you might as well tailgate after the game or hang out in your car listening to post-game radio while traffic thins.


Congestion Zones to Avoid: If you’re familiar with the area or using a driver’s GPS, note that Route 1 is the main artery that all cars use to enter/exit parking. Avoid smaller roads in the immediate vicinity (like North/South Street in Foxboro, or Pine Street) as they’ll be restricted or jammed. Sometimes, locals try to cut through residential roads – police often block these to keep traffic flowing on the main routes. It’s best to stick to the signed traffic patterns; the stadium and state police have an established system (for example, they may make Route 1 one-way in certain directions to streamline flow). Listen to any police officers directing traffic – they might wave you forward even if your GPS suggests a turn.


In summary, arrive early, park smart, and be patient afterward. The World Cup experience will be worth it, and with a bit of planning you can minimize the hassles of getting 60,000+ people in and out of a single location.
Travel Tips for International Visitors
If you’re coming from abroad (or even if you’re a domestic traveler new to New England), keep these tips in mind to make your trip smoother:
Mobile Phone & Data: Staying connected is extremely useful for navigation, translation, ride-hailing, etc. We recommend getting a USA SIM card or eSIM for your phone to have local data service . Many airports (including Boston Logan and PVD) have kiosks or vending machines for prepaid SIMs. You can also buy a prepaid SIM from carriers like T-Mobile or AT&T at retail stores. Having mobile data means you can get live traffic updates and transit info on the go  – crucial during events. If your phone supports eSIM, consider downloading an eSIM plan (apps like Airalo, GigSky, or the carriers’ own apps offer this) before you leave. Public Wi-Fi is available in some places (airports, hotels, maybe the stadium), but not guaranteed everywhere, so cellular data is very helpful. Also, a heads-up: the U.S. has different LTE/5G bands – most modern international phones work fine, but very old or regional models might have compatibility issues on certain networks.


Navigation Apps: Use Google Maps, Apple Maps, or Waze for driving directions. Waze is popular locally for real-time alerts (it can warn you of accidents, police speed traps, etc.). Google Maps is excellent for public transportation schedules and walking directions. Download offline maps of Massachusetts/Rhode Island in case your signal drops. The MBTA has an app (MBTA Train or MBTA-endorsed apps like Transit) for commuter rail and subway info . If you’re taking Amtrak, the Amtrak app is useful for tickets and status.


Driving Rules & Etiquette: In Massachusetts, as in all of the U.S., we drive on the right-hand side of the road. Always wear seatbelts (mandatory for driver and passengers). Speed limits on highways around Foxborough are typically 65 mph (~105 km/h), dropping to 55 or 50 mph closer to Boston. It’s common for traffic to flow ~5-10 mph above the limit, but be cautious – state troopers do enforce speeds, especially in construction zones (fines are doubled there). Right turn on red is generally allowed after a full stop, unless a sign specifically says “No Turn on Red.” This might be new for some visitors, but it’s legal in most U.S. states. Pedestrian crossings: drivers must yield to pedestrians at crosswalks (and pedestrians generally have the right-of-way when crossing on a “Walk” signal – cars turning must wait for them). Watch out for pedestrians in city areas; in Boston/Cambridge, people jaywalk frequently, but in smaller towns like Foxborough, pedestrians will stick to crosswalks at intersections.


Aggressive Driving: Massachusetts (especially around Boston) is known for aggressive drivers (“Masshole” is a local joking term). Don’t be offended if you get honked at – it’s often not personal, just a way locals communicate on the road. Drive confidently but not recklessly. Use your turn signals (even if locals sometimes don’t), and try to go with the flow. On multi-lane highways, the left lane is generally the passing (fast) lane – if you’re going slower, keep right. At 4-way stop intersections, it’s first-come, first-go (or yield to the car on your right if you arrive simultaneously).


Tolls: As mentioned, Massachusetts uses cashless tolling on certain highways . If your route from the airport or your lodging involves the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90), the Tobin Bridge, or the harbor tunnels in Boston, there’s no cash booth – cameras will charge the vehicle. In a rental car, this typically means the rental company will bill your credit card later with the toll plus a service fee (unless you opt into their toll program). Ask your rental agency about their toll policy. Alternatively, if you have your own E-ZPass transponder from another state, it will work here. Some GPS apps can help you avoid toll roads if needed (but that might add a lot of time). Parking: When in cities like Providence or Boston, note that many streets require resident permits or have time limits. Look for signage before leaving your car on any street. Parking garages in Boston are expensive (often $30-40/day), one reason we steer you to stay outside the city.


Car Rental Norms: If you’re renting a car, you’ll need a valid driver’s license. An International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended if your license is not in English, though if it’s in English (or a language like Spanish/French that agents can interpret) you usually don’t need an IDP for short-term visits. The driving age is 16 in MA, but rental companies require renters to be 25 or older for the best rates. Many will rent to those 21-24 but with a hefty “young driver fee.” It’s rare to find rentals for under 21. Cars in the U.S. are almost all automatic transmission, so no need to worry about shifting if you’re used to manual – in fact, a manual car would be hard to find. Fuel (gasoline) is sold by the gallon (3.785 liters) and as of early 2025 costs around $3-4 per gallon (prices might fluctuate by 2026). You usually pump fuel yourself at gas stations – pay at the pump with a credit card or pre-pay inside. Most rentals use regular unleaded fuel; if you rent a larger SUV it might suggest premium, but check the rental company’s guidance. Rental Insurance: Your own travel insurance or credit card might offer rental car coverage; if not, be prepared that the counter agent will try to sell you additional insurance. In the U.S., liability insurance is mandatory – check if your booking rate includes the necessary coverage (for foreigners, some sites bundle it)  . It’s often cheaper to buy insurance ahead of time than at the counter. Lastly, inspect your rental car for any existing damage and report it before leaving.


Money and Tipping: The United States uses the US Dollar. Credit and debit cards are widely accepted – even small vendors often accept Visa/Mastercard, and contactless pay (Apple Pay, etc.) is common. However, it’s good to have some cash for things like tips or small tolls (though tolls in MA are electronic, some older toll bridges in neighboring states or small parking lots might require cash). Tipping is customary in the U.S. and expected in many service situations. At restaurants, if you have table service, tip your server ~15-20% of the bill (before tax) – higher (20%+) for excellent service. For taxis or rideshare, tipping ~10-15% is normal (or at least a couple of dollars for a shorter ride; in apps like Uber, you can add a tip afterward). Hotel staff: it’s courteous to tip bellhops $1-2 per bag they carry, and leave a few dollars per day for housekeeping (you can leave it in the room with a note upon checkout). Bartenders typically get $1 per drink or 15-20% of the tab. While tipping is technically voluntary, remember that service workers often rely on those tips as part of their income  – so if you don’t tip for good service, it’s frowned upon. Fast-food places or cafes where you just pick up your order don’t require tipping (though some have tip jars – up to you). No need to tip in retail stores or when buying tickets/merchandise.


Language and Etiquette: English is the main language. In tourist areas, you’ll find plenty of Spanish speakers as well. Most stadium signage will be English (possibly Spanish and French for World Cup). If you need translation help, having Google Translate on your phone can assist. Local mannerisms: New Englanders (especially Bostonians) are known for being pretty direct and not overly chatty with strangers, but they are generally polite and will help if you ask. Don’t hesitate to ask a question if you need – people will usually oblige. Standing in line (queue) is the norm – “cutting” in line is a big no-no. At the stadium, you’ll see enthusiastic cheering, but almost always in a friendly spirit. It’s fine to wear opposing team gear; incidents of fan conflicts are rare at soccer matches here, especially compared to some other countries. If you’re invited to a tailgate or gathering, it’s nice to bring something (drinks, snacks) to share. Smoking is not allowed inside the stadium or most indoor public places in MA (including restaurants, bars). Some outdoor areas at the stadium may have designated smoking sections.


July 4th Considerations: Since the World Cup overlaps with Independence Day (July 4, 2026 – which is also America’s 250th “Semiquincentennial”), there will be major celebrations. Boston, in particular, will host big events like the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on July 4. If you plan to partake, be ready for huge crowds in Boston on the days around the 4th. That’s one reason staying outside the city can be beneficial – you can choose to go in for the day of festivities, but retreat to a calmer place afterward. Keep in mind, July 3-5 might have road closures in Boston and heavy traffic everywhere during the holiday. Fireworks displays also occur in many towns on July 3 or 4 – if you’re in Providence or others, check local event listings for a fun experience (Providence often has festivities along the river). On the holiday, many stores and restaurants will still be open, but government offices/banks will be closed.


Health & Safety: In June/July, the weather in Massachusetts is warm – average highs ~24–29°C (75–85°F)  with some humidity. Stay hydrated, wear sunscreen if you’ll be tailgating under the sun, and note that sudden thunderstorms can roll through (keep a poncho or light rain jacket handy for summer rains). Emergency number is 911 for any serious issues – police, fire, ambulance. For non-emergencies (like needing directions or minor issues), you can approach police officers or stadium staff – they’re used to assisting visitors during big events. Massachusetts is generally safe; just use common sense as you would anywhere. Keep your valuables secure in crowded areas, and when driving, don’t leave bags visible in a parked car (to avoid tempting theft). In the unlikely event you encounter any harassment or overly unruly fans, seek out security – World Cup crowds will be diverse and family-friendly, so stadium security will be attentive to making it a safe environment.


Miscellaneous: Electric outlets are standard North American Type A/B (120V, 60Hz) – bring adaptors for your devices if needed. Sim cards we covered – also note that USA country code is +1 for phones. Time zone for Boston is Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4) in June/July 2026. Measurement units: The U.S. uses miles, feet, pounds, and Fahrenheit. So distance to the stadium might be in miles, temperature will be given in °F (e.g. 85°F = ~29°C). A quick tip: 60°F is cool (~15°C), 75°F ~ comfortable (~24°C), 90°F+ is hot (~32°C+). For road distances, 1 mile = 1.6 km. Speed 60 mph ≈ 100 km/h.


By planning ahead with these tips, you’ll navigate the World Cup chaos like a pro. Enjoy your trip to New England – you’ll get to experience world-class soccer along with the region’s rich history and summer charm. With alternative airports, strategic lodging, and smart travel choices, you can focus on the matches and the memories while avoiding the worst crowds and headaches. Welcome, and have a wicked good time at World Cup 2026 in Foxborough!
