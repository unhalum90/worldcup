# World Cup 2026 Dallas: Travel & Logistics Guide

2026 FIFA World Cup: Dallas (Arlington) Visitor's Guide — Phase 1
1.0 Executive Overview: Why Early Planning is Non-Negotiable
Welcome to the essential "Phase 1" logistics guide for your 2026 FIFA World Cup experience in the Dallas-Arlington metropolitan area. With nine matches scheduled, including a semi-final, the region is preparing for an unprecedented influx of global visitors. Securing your travel and accommodations well in advance is not just recommended—it is critical. The unique logistical landscape of North Texas presents three core challenges that demand early and strategic planning.
Limited Lodging: The most convenient hotels, those within walking distance of AT&T Stadium in Arlington's Entertainment District, are extremely scarce. They will be the first to sell out, likely at premium rates, forcing the vast majority of visitors to find accommodations in surrounding cities like Fort Worth, Irving, or Dallas.
Complex Transportation: AT&T Stadium is located in Arlington, the largest city in the United States without a direct, city-wide public rail system. This makes the "last mile" journey to the venue a key logistical hurdle that requires careful planning, whether by rental car, rideshare, or a combination of commuter rail and dedicated event shuttles.
Extreme Summer Heat: Matches will take place in June and July, when North Texas temperatures can consistently reach 35–40°C (95–104°F). This oppressive heat dictates everything from your daily itinerary to your hydration strategy.
This guide provides the strategic playbook to outmaneuver the crowds, the costs, and the climate.
2.0 Strategic Booking Timeline & Pre-Travel Checklist
Successful travel planning for a global event of this magnitude requires strategic timing and meticulous preparation. The following timeline and checklist are designed to position you ahead of the curve, ensuring a smoother and more cost-effective trip.
Key Booking Windows
Flights: For the best selection and pricing, aim to book your air travel before December 2025. Demand for flights into the Dallas-Fort Worth region will surge as the tournament approaches.
Hotels: A second wave of hotel availability may emerge in January-February 2026 after FIFA finalizes match schedules and releases any reserved room blocks. However, the safest and most prudent strategy is to book your accommodations as early as possible using refundable rates.

With your timeline set, the first major decision is choosing your point of entry into the vast North Texas region.
3.0 Air Travel Strategy: Choosing Your Arrival Airport
While Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW) is the primary gateway to the region, North Texas and its surrounding areas offer several alternative airports. Your choice can strategically influence your budget, ground transportation needs, and overall travel itinerary.
For the Premium / Convenience-Focused Traveler
Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW): For the traveler prioritizing a seamless, no-compromise arrival, DFW is the undisputed heavyweight. As a major global hub for American Airlines, it offers extensive flight options from around the world. Its prime location, approximately 12 miles from AT&T Stadium (a 20-30 minute drive), and ample rental car facilities make it the most convenient option. Expect this convenience to come with higher airfares during the tournament.
For the Mid-Range / Balanced Traveler
Dallas Love Field (DAL): As the top domestic alternative, DAL is a hub for Southwest Airlines and often features more affordable flights from over 100 U.S. cities. It is located about a 20-30 minute drive from the stadium but offers no direct international flights. This is an excellent choice for travelers connecting from other U.S. gateways.
Austin-Bergstrom International (AUS): For visitors who wish to combine their World Cup trip with a visit to the vibrant city of Austin, AUS is a viable option. It is located approximately 200 miles south of Arlington (a 3-hour drive) and may offer cheaper international flights from select European and Mexican hubs. This option requires planning for a significant ground transfer.
For the Budget / Adventure-Oriented Traveler
Houston (IAH/HOU) or Oklahoma City (OKC): These cities offer long-distance alternatives that can yield significant cost savings on airfare. Houston's George Bush Intercontinental (IAH) is a major international hub, located 240-260 miles away (a 4-6 hour drive). Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport (OKC) is a domestic airport about 200 miles away (a 3-hour drive). Choosing this option requires factoring in the cost and time of ground transportation, such as a rental car, intercity bus, or the Amtrak train service from OKC to Fort Worth.
Your choice of arrival airport directly influences your lodging strategy, which is the next critical component of your plan.
4.0 Accommodation Strategy: Where to Stay in the Metroplex
The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is a sprawling urban region, offering a wide array of lodging zones. The core decision for visitors is balancing the convenience and energy of staying near the stadium against the cost savings and unique experiences offered by other areas. This breakdown analyzes the Metroplex's key lodging zones, each offering a different answer to the fundamental trade-off: Do you prioritize proximity or price?
Zone 1: Arlington Entertainment District (The Epicenter)
Vibe: Premium stadium energy, maximum convenience.
Commute to Stadium: Walking distance (5-15 minutes).
Analysis: This is the most convenient but also the most expensive and supply-constrained option. Hotels here will sell out extremely fast. If you find availability that fits your budget, book it immediately.
Tiered Options:
Premium: Live! by Loews, Loews Arlington Hotel.
Mid-Range: Sheraton Arlington, Courtyard Dallas Arlington.
Budget: Comfort Suites Arlington, Executive Inn Arlington.
Bottom Line: If budget is no object and convenience is everything, this is the only play. Book yesterday.
Zone 2: Fort Worth (The Cultural Hub)
Vibe: Relaxed pace with a distinct Western heritage.
Commute to Stadium: 20-30 minute drive.
Analysis: Fort Worth is an excellent alternative, offering a vibrant downtown (Sundance Square), the historic Stockyards for a true Texas cultural experience, and a wide range of hotel inventory. A key advantage is the TEXRail commuter line providing a direct link from DFW Airport to its central station.
Tiered Options:
Premium: Omni Fort Worth Hotel, The Worthington Renaissance.
Mid-Range: Hilton Fort Worth, Hampton Inn Downtown.
Budget: Numerous 2-star chains and motels are available along major highways.
Bottom Line: The best option for travelers who want a genuine Texas cultural experience alongside their football, with a manageable commute.
Zone 3: Irving / Las Colinas (The Convenient Mid-Point)
Vibe: Suburban calm, family-friendly, and business-oriented.
Commute to Stadium: 15-25 minute drive.
Analysis: This area represents an excellent logistical balance. It is conveniently located near DFW Airport, offers direct DART rail access to Dallas for sightseeing, is a reasonable drive to the stadium in Arlington, and even features a picturesque canal with waterfront dining for relaxing evenings.
Tiered Options:
Premium: Omni Las Colinas Hotel, Four Seasons Resort.
Mid-Range: NYLO Las Colinas Hotel, Marriott Las Colinas.
Budget: A large cluster of inexpensive motels catering to airport travelers provides ample value options.
Bottom Line: For travelers prioritizing a stress-free arrival and departure from DFW with easy access to Dallas sightseeing, Las Colinas is the most strategically sound choice.
Zone 4: Grand Prairie / Mid-Cities (The Value Play)
Vibe: Practical suburban base.
Commute to Stadium: 12-20 minute drive.
Analysis: Our analysis identifies this area as the leading "sleeper pick" for value-conscious travelers with a rental car. It offers great value and some of the shortest driving commutes to the stadium outside of Arlington itself.
Tiered Options:
Mid-Range/Budget: Look for well-rated options like the Comfort Suites Grand Prairie, which offers rooms under $80 in the off-season, alongside various La Quinta and Courtyard properties.
Bottom Line: The savvy traveler's choice for maximizing value without sacrificing proximity, provided you have a rental car.
Zone 5: North Dallas Suburbs (Plano/Frisco) & Denton (The Long-Stay Base)
Vibe: Quieter suburban living (Plano/Frisco) or a lively college town (Denton).
Commute to Stadium: 45-60 minute drive.
Analysis: These northern suburbs are best suited for travelers on extended stays, families seeking a quieter home base, or dedicated soccer fans interested in visiting the National Soccer Hall of Fame in Frisco. A rental car and a tolerance for a long commute are essential for staying in these zones.
Bottom Line: A practical base for long-haul family trips or die-hard soccer fans, but only if you accept the trade-off of a significant daily commute.
Once you've selected your lodging zone, the final piece of the logistical puzzle is determining how you will get to the stadium on match day.
5.0 Match Day Transportation: Your Complete Guide to Reaching the Stadium
Reaching AT&T Stadium on match day requires careful planning. While Arlington lacks a comprehensive public transit system, special services are being implemented for the World Cup to bridge this gap. This section breaks down every available option, allowing you to choose based on your priorities for cost, time, and convenience.

Detailed Transportation Analysis
The Official Plan: Rail + Dedicated Shuttles
A special hybrid system is planned for the tournament. The primary route will involve taking the Trinity Railway Express (TRE) commuter train—from either Dallas or Fort Worth—to the CentrePort/DFW Station. From there, fans will transfer to a dedicated, private shuttle service for the final leg to the stadium. Additionally, an Express Bus "bridge" service is planned to run directly from Victory Station in Dallas to AT&T Stadium, providing another crucial link for fans.
Rental Car & Parking
If driving, plan to arrive several hours early to avoid the worst of the traffic congestion and to enjoy the pre-match atmosphere. To secure cheaper parking and avoid the hassle of sold-out lots, use apps like ParkWhiz or SpotHero to pre-book a spot in one of the many private lots located a short walk from the stadium.
Rideshare & Taxis
The stadium area has designated drop-off and pickup zones for services like Uber and Lyft. Be explicitly warned: post-match surge pricing is almost certain, and wait times can be extensive. Be prepared not only for high costs but also for potential driver cancellations and long waits as tens of thousands of fans request rides simultaneously. A pro tip is to walk a few blocks away from the immediate stadium gridlock before ordering your ride.
The Pro Move: Local Bar Shuttles
This is a proven local favorite. Arlington establishments like J. Gilligan's Bar & Grill and Grease Monkey Burger Shop offer a park-and-shuttle service. For a nominal fee (around $10), you can park at their location, enjoy pre-game food and drinks, and take their bus to and from the stadium.
Regardless of your chosen mode of transport, every visitor must be aware of the following on-the-ground realities.
6.0 Essential Field Guide: Safety, Heat, and Local Know-How
These on-the-ground tips are critical for ensuring a safe, enjoyable, and financially sound trip. Pay close attention to the parking warning.
Critical Parking Warning
Under no circumstances should you park at the Walmart or in surrounding business and residential lots across from the stadium for an event. Towing operations are notoriously aggressive, with "spotters" in unmarked cars watching for people who park and walk toward the stadium. Vehicles are often towed in under 15 minutes, with release fees costing $300 or more. It is not a viable cost-saving measure and will ruin your match day experience.
Beat the Texas Heat
Expect daily high temperatures of 35-40°C (95-104°F).
Stay hydrated by drinking water consistently throughout the day, not just when you feel thirsty.
Pack and use sunscreen, and wear light, breathable clothing (e.g., cotton or linen).
General Safety & Tips
Always be aware of your surroundings, particularly in crowded transportation hubs and entertainment districts.
Credit and debit cards are widely accepted; cash is useful for smaller purchases or tips.
The area immediately surrounding the stadium is heavily policed during events and is generally considered safe to walk.
Remember that AT&T Stadium has a strict clear bags only policy for entry.
7.0 Advice for Families & Groups
Traveling with children or in a large group requires specific logistical considerations to ensure comfort and manage costs.
For Families: To help children escape the intense summer heat, we strongly recommend booking a hotel with a pool. Excellent options with desirable pool areas include the Sheraton Arlington and the Omni Fort Worth Hotel.
For Groups: Renting a larger house in a nearby suburb like Grand Prairie can be a highly cost-effective strategy. This allows the group to split accommodation costs and potentially share a single rental vehicle and parking pass.
Accessibility: AT&T Stadium offers full ADA access. Designated accessible parking is available in Lot 10.
