This itinerary begins in charming Kansas City, offering a family-friendly atmosphere near its fan festival, before moving to vibrant Dallas for its expansive fan activities and big-city experience. Ideal for families wanting a balanced mix of city vibes and convenient fan fest access.

‚úàÔ∏è
Flights
International: Paris (CDG) to Kansas City (MCI) on June 13th. Domestic: Kansas City (MCI) to Dallas (DFW) around June 19th. International: Dallas (DFW) to Paris (CDG) on June 23rd. (Open-jaw itinerary recommended for efficiency and to avoid backtracking).

$1,800 - $2,500 per person (International round-trip), $150 - $250 per person (Domestic one-way)

üèôÔ∏è
Kansas City
Recommended Lodging Areas:
Crown Center
Directly adjacent to Union Station Fan Plaza, this area is exceptionally family-friendly with attractions like Legoland Discovery Center and SEA LIFE Kansas City. It offers dedicated hotels (often with pools) suitable for families with a child, all within a moderate budget.

$200 - $300/night

per night

To Stadium: 20-30 minute ride-share/taxi or dedicated World Cup shuttle service expected to operate from central points including Union Station to Arrowhead Stadium.

To Fan Fest: 5-10 minute walk to Union Station Fan Plaza.

‚úì Pros:

‚Ä¢ Exceptional family amenities and activities
‚Ä¢ Direct walking access to Fan Fest and major attractions
‚Ä¢ Generally quieter and safer than other downtown areas at night
‚ö† Cons:

‚Ä¢ Limited public transit for wider city exploration (beyond the Streetcar)
‚Ä¢ Can feel a bit 'self-contained' and less integrated into other downtown districts
üé´ Match Day Logistics:
For Arrowhead Stadium, ride-sharing services (Uber/Lyft) will be heavily utilized, and surge pricing is common on match days. Dedicated World Cup shuttle services from central points, including Union Station, are expected to be available and highly recommended. Plan to book these in advance or arrive early.

üí° Insider Tips:
‚Ä¢ Kansas City's Streetcar is free and runs along Main Street, connecting Union Station (Fan Fest) to the Power & Light District and River Market, making central exploration easy.
‚Ä¢ Arrowhead Stadium is about 10 miles east of downtown; plan ample time for travel on match days. Shuttles are key.
‚Ä¢ Visit the National WWI Museum and Memorial, located right next to Union Station, offering fantastic views of the city skyline and engaging exhibits for all ages.
üèôÔ∏è
Dallas
Recommended Lodging Areas:
Downtown Dallas / Main Street District
A central location with excellent DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) Green Line access directly to Fair Park Fan Festival. This area boasts numerous hotel options catering to a moderate budget, often including amenities like pools, great for families. It provides easy access to other city attractions and dining.

$220 - $320/night

per night

To Stadium: Take DART Green Line to West End Station (10-15 min), then anticipate special World Cup shuttles or ride-share services to AT&T Stadium (Arlington). Total travel time 45-60 minutes.

To Fan Fest: 10-15 minute direct ride on DART Green Line to Fair Park Station.

‚úì Pros:

‚Ä¢ Excellent DART connectivity for Dallas attractions and Fan Fest
‚Ä¢ Walkable downtown area with a good variety of dining and attractions
‚Ä¢ Many hotel choices within a moderate budget
‚ö† Cons:

‚Ä¢ Stadium access requires multiple steps/transfers, as it's outside Dallas proper
‚Ä¢ Can be very busy and crowded during peak times
üé´ Match Day Logistics:
AT&T Stadium is located in Arlington, roughly 20 miles west of downtown Dallas, and is NOT directly served by Dallas's DART rail. From Downtown, your best bet is to take the DART Green Line to a central transfer point (like West End Station) and then use designated World Cup shuttle buses or ride-sharing services. Pre-booking shuttles or ride-shares is highly advisable.

üí° Insider Tips:
‚Ä¢ AT&T Stadium is often misrepresented as being 'in Dallas'; remember it's in Arlington, a separate city. This significantly impacts transit planning.
‚Ä¢ The Dallas DART system is highly efficient for navigating Dallas itself and reaching the Fan Fest. Purchase a reloadable GoPass card or use the GoPass app for unlimited rides on a day pass.
‚Ä¢ Consider a visit to the Dallas World Aquarium or the Perot Museum of Nature and Science for engaging family entertainment.
Lone Star Welcome, Heartland Farewell
This option immerses you in the vibrant energy of Dallas first, with extensive fan fest access and big-city attractions, before a memorable journey to Kansas City, enjoying its unique cultural scene and fan experience as a perfect closing act. Offers a different pace and cultural exploration.

‚úàÔ∏è
Flights
International: Paris (CDG) to Dallas (DFW) on June 13th. Domestic: Dallas (DFW) to Kansas City (MCI) around June 19th. International: Kansas City (MCI) to Paris (CDG) on June 23rd. (Open-jaw itinerary recommended for seamless travel).

$1,800 - $2,500 per person (International round-trip), $150 - $250 per person (Domestic one-way)

üèôÔ∏è
Dallas
Recommended Lodging Areas:
Deep Ellum
A lively, artsy district known for its eclectic music, vibrant murals, and diverse dining scene. It offers exceptionally close proximity to Fair Park Fan Festival (walkable or a very short DART ride). Deep Ellum provides a unique, energetic atmosphere, with boutique hotels that fit a moderate budget for those seeking culture and entertainment.

$250 - $350/night

per night

To Stadium: Walk to Deep Ellum DART Station, take the Green Line to West End Station (10 min), then connect to World Cup shuttles or ride-share to AT&T Stadium. Total 45-60 minutes.

To Fan Fest: 15-20 minute enjoyable walk to Fair Park or a very short DART Green Line ride (1-2 stops).

‚úì Pros:

‚Ä¢ Vibrant cultural scene, unique dining and shops
‚Ä¢ Excellent proximity to Fan Fest with easy walking/DART access
‚Ä¢ Lively atmosphere for evening entertainment (consider if traveling with a young child)
‚ö† Cons:

‚Ä¢ Can be noisy in the evenings, which might affect sleep for a child
‚Ä¢ Hotels might be on the higher end of a moderate budget due to demand and unique offerings
‚Ä¢ Less direct access to some general Dallas attractions via DART than staying directly Downtown
üé´ Match Day Logistics:
Similar to the previous option, plan for dedicated World Cup shuttles or ride-sharing services from a central DART station (like West End) to reach AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Factor in potential traffic delays and plan to depart well in advance of the match.

üí° Insider Tips:
‚Ä¢ Deep Ellum is fantastic for exploring street art and enjoying diverse cuisine during the day, which is very family-friendly. Evenings can be more adult-oriented, but still safe and vibrant.
‚Ä¢ For a slightly quieter but still culturally rich experience, the Dallas Arts District is adjacent and home to several world-class museums.
‚Ä¢ Utilizing DART is crucial for getting to the Fan Fest and around Dallas. Parking near Fair Park during the Fan Fest will be extremely difficult and expensive.
üèôÔ∏è
Kansas City
Recommended Lodging Areas:
Crossroads Arts District
This trendy and artistic neighborhood, located just south of Downtown, is easily accessible to Union Station Fan Plaza via a short walk or free Streetcar ride. It offers unique hotels, art galleries, and an excellent dining scene, providing a different vibe from Crown Center but still very appealing and family-friendly for cultural exploration within a moderate budget.

$180 - $280/night

per night

To Stadium: 20-30 minute ride-share/taxi or dedicated World Cup shuttle service to Arrowhead Stadium. The Streetcar can connect you to Union Station, where shuttles may depart.

To Fan Fest: 10-15 minute walk or 5-minute Streetcar ride directly to Union Station Fan Plaza.

‚úì Pros:

‚Ä¢ Vibrant arts and food scene with unique shops and galleries
‚Ä¢ Good balance of activity and relaxation, generally quieter than the Power & Light District
‚Ä¢ Excellent free Streetcar access connecting to major downtown attractions
‚ö† Cons:

‚Ä¢ Fewer dedicated 'child-specific' attractions directly within the zone compared to Crown Center
‚Ä¢ Some areas can be more industrial, especially at night, though generally safe and well-lit.
üé´ Match Day Logistics:
Ride-sharing services or dedicated World Cup shuttles will be the primary modes of transport to Arrowhead Stadium. The free Streetcar can take you to Union Station, which is a likely hub for stadium shuttles.

üí° Insider Tips:
‚Ä¢ Kansas City is world-renowned for its BBQ ‚Äì make sure to try some! Many top-rated joints are a short ride from the Crossroads area.
‚Ä¢ The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum and the American Jazz Museum are nearby in the 18th & Vine Historic Jazz District, offering rich cultural and educational experiences.
‚Ä¢ If your visit aligns with a First Friday (first Friday of the month), the Crossroads Arts District comes alive with open galleries and street vendors, but expect large crowds.
