[INTRO - Hero Section]

"What's up everyone! Welcome to New York - the biggest stage in the world.

Okay, technically the stadium is in New Jersey, but let's be real - this is the New York City metropolitan area experience.

MetLife Stadium is massive, hosting Giants and Jets games, and for the World Cup, it's going to be one of the premier venues. Big matches, huge crowds, and the energy of New York City nearby.

If you want the ultimate World Cup experience with world-class dining, nightlife, and culture, this is it.

Let's dive in."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"The geography here is important:

MetLife Stadium is in East Rutherford, New Jersey - about 8 miles west of Midtown Manhattan.

Key areas in NYC:
- Manhattan: The iconic borough - Times Square, Central Park, Empire State Building, everything you picture when you think NYC
- Brooklyn: Hip neighborhoods, great food, Williamsburg, DUMBO, Prospect Park
- Queens: Diverse neighborhoods, incredible international food, where JFK airport is
- The Bronx: Yankee Stadium, real NYC grit
- Jersey City / Hoboken: Across the Hudson, sometimes cheaper hotels with easy access to NYC

Airports:
- JFK (Queens): The main international hub
- Newark (EWR): In New Jersey, actually closer to MetLife Stadium
- LaGuardia (LGA): Domestic flights, in Queens

The stadium is accessible from Manhattan, but plan your transport carefully."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you need to know about New York:

IT'S EXPENSIVE. Like, really expensive. Hotels, food, drinks, everything costs more here than almost anywhere else in the US. Budget accordingly.

But here's the thing - you're getting New York City. The food scene is unmatched. The diversity is incredible - you can eat cuisine from literally any country. The nightlife, the culture, the energy... there's nothing quite like it.

June and July weather is hot and humid - mid-80s typically, but it can spike higher. The city gets sweaty. But the stadium is outdoors with no roof, so you'll feel the weather.

Also, New Yorkers move FAST. Walk with purpose, don't stop in the middle of the sidewalk, and embrace the pace."

[LODGING SECTION]

"Lodging in the NYC area:

Manhattan: The dream, but pricey. Midtown puts you near everything. Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen, Lower East Side all have options. Expect $300+ per night minimum for decent hotels during World Cup.

Brooklyn: Can be slightly cheaper with great neighborhoods. Williamsburg, Downtown Brooklyn, and DUMBO have good options and easy subway access.

Jersey City / Hoboken: Actually smart for this World Cup. You're closer to MetLife Stadium, often cheaper than Manhattan, and PATH trains get you to NYC quickly.

Newark area: Near the airport and not far from the stadium. More affordable, less exciting.

Near MetLife Stadium: Limited hotels in East Rutherford specifically. Most fans will commute from NYC or nearby Jersey areas.

Here's my tip: If budget is a concern, look at Jersey City or Hoboken. You get easy NYC access, lower prices, and you're on the right side of the Hudson for MetLife."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to MetLife Stadium:

NJ Transit Rail: This is the move. Trains run from Penn Station (Manhattan) directly to the Meadowlands Sports Complex station right at the stadium. Fast, reliable, and you skip traffic entirely.

Bus: NJ Transit buses also run to the stadium from Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan.

Driving: Possible, but traffic through the Lincoln Tunnel or across the George Washington Bridge can be brutal. Parking at MetLife is expensive.

Rideshare: Uber and Lyft work, but surge pricing after games is extreme, and pickup logistics in the massive parking lots are chaotic.

From the airports: 
- EWR (Newark) to the stadium is close - maybe 15-20 minutes
- JFK to Manhattan is 60-90 minutes, then you transit to the stadium
- LGA is closest to Manhattan

Pro tip: Take NJ Transit from Penn Station. Seriously. It drops you right at the stadium, it's relatively cheap, and you avoid the nightmare of driving. Buy your tickets in advance on the app to skip lines.

Post-game, trains back to Penn Station will be crowded but they'll run extra service. Be patient.
