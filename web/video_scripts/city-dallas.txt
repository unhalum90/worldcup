[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hey everyone! Welcome to Dallas - or more accurately, the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex - one of the 16 host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

AT&T Stadium in Arlington is absolutely massive - this could be the largest venue in the tournament when fully expanded. That giant video board, the retractable roof - it's going to be an incredible atmosphere.

Let's get into everything you need to know."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Looking at the map, the first thing to understand is that AT&T Stadium is in Arlington, which sits right between Dallas and Fort Worth.

Key areas:
- Downtown Dallas is about 20 miles east - this is where most visitors stay
- Fort Worth is about 15 miles west - more of a Western, laid-back vibe
- Arlington itself has the stadium plus Six Flags and other attractions
- DFW Airport is north, roughly equidistant from both cities

The metroplex is HUGE and spread out. There's no avoiding cars here."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's the critical thing about Dallas:

There is NO public transit to the stadium.

Let me repeat that - Arlington has no rail connection. DART rail serves Dallas, but it doesn't go to Arlington. You WILL need a car, rideshare, or shuttle to get to the game.

Also, it's Texas in June - expect temperatures in the mid-90s Fahrenheit. The stadium is climate-controlled with that retractable roof, but outside tailgating will be hot. Bring water, sunscreen, and pace yourself."

[LODGING SECTION]

"For lodging, you have options across the metroplex:

Downtown Dallas has the most hotels, nightlife, and things to do. You'll be about 30 minutes from the stadium depending on traffic.

Arlington has hotels right near the stadium if you want to minimize travel. Great for flying in just for the match.

Fort Worth is worth considering if you want a different vibe - the Stockyards are a unique Texas experience, and you're closer to the stadium than Downtown Dallas.

The whole area has tons of hotels at every price point. Just factor in that you'll be driving or ridesharing no matter where you stay."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to AT&T Stadium - let's be real, you need wheels.

Driving: There's tons of parking around the stadium, from official lots to private residential yards. Prices range from $20 for remote lots to $60+ for close-in spots. Traffic getting out can be slow, but nothing like Boston.

Rideshare: Uber and Lyft work well here. Surge pricing happens after events but it's more manageable than some cities since the area is designed for cars. Set your pickup point clearly - the stadium area gets chaotic.

Shuttles: Look for organized shuttles from Dallas hotels. TEXRail runs from DFW Airport to Fort Worth if you're coming from that direction.

Texas Express: Some special event buses run from various locations - check closer to the tournament for World Cup specific services.

Pro tip: Texas tailgating culture is real. Arrive early, set up in a lot, and enjoy the pre-game atmosphere. The stadium has great AC so you'll cool down once you're inside.

That's Dallas! Full details at worldcup26fanzone.com. Y'all come back now!"
