[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hey everyone! Welcome to Vancouver - arguably the most beautiful World Cup host city.

I'm not exaggerating. Vancouver sits between the Pacific Ocean and the Coast Mountains. You can ski in the morning and kayak in the afternoon. The scenery is absolutely stunning.

BC Place is right downtown with a retractable roof - so weather won't be an issue. Plus, Vancouver hosted events during the 2010 Winter Olympics, so they know how to put on a show.

Great food, incredible nature, friendly people, and world-class soccer coming in 2026.

Let's dive in."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Vancouver geography:

BC Place is in downtown Vancouver, in the Yaletown/False Creek area. Location-wise, this is one of the most accessible stadiums in the tournament.

Key areas to know:
- Downtown: The urban core - Robson Street shopping, restaurants, nightlife
- Gastown: Historic neighborhood with cobblestones, trendy restaurants, the Steam Clock
- Yaletown: Upscale area near the stadium, great restaurants and patios
- Granville Island: Public market, artisan shops, food vendors - don't miss this
- Stanley Park: One of the best urban parks in the world, right downtown
- Kitsilano: Beach neighborhood, relaxed vibe, great views
- Vancouver International Airport (YVR): South of the city on Sea Island, about 25-30 minutes to downtown

The city is very walkable and has excellent transit."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you should know about Vancouver:

The weather is PERFECT for summer soccer. June and July are Vancouver's best months - mid-60s to mid-70s, often sunny, low humidity. It's genuinely pleasant. The rainy Vancouver reputation is for winter - summer is beautiful.

BC Place has a retractable roof, so even if it does rain, matches can continue comfortably.

Vancouver is expensive. It's consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in North America for housing and hotels. Budget accordingly.

But here's the payoff: the food scene is incredible, especially Asian cuisine. Vancouver has arguably the best Chinese food outside of Asia. Sushi, ramen, dim sum - it's all world-class.

Also, nature is right there. You can be in mountains, on beaches, or in rainforests within 30 minutes of downtown."

[LODGING SECTION]

"Lodging in Vancouver:

Downtown: The most convenient option. Walk to the stadium, walk to restaurants, walk to Stanley Park. Lots of hotels from budget to luxury. Robson Street and Yaletown areas are great.

Gastown: Historic character with great restaurants. A short walk to the stadium. Some boutique hotels and Airbnbs.

Yaletown: Right next to BC Place. Upscale restaurants and bars. Very convenient for match days.

West End: Residential neighborhood near Stanley Park and English Bay. Some hotel options, more local feel.

Kitsilano: Across False Creek, beach vibes. Further from the stadium but beautiful neighborhood. You'd need transit or water taxi to get to matches.

Vancouver hotels are pricey. Consider booking early, or look at Airbnb options. Areas further from downtown (Burnaby, Richmond) can be cheaper with good transit access."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to BC Place:

Walking: If you're staying downtown, you can probably walk to the stadium. It's centrally located. From most downtown hotels, it's 10-20 minutes on foot.

SkyTrain: Vancouver's SkyTrain is excellent. The Stadium-Chinatown station is literally at BC Place. The Canada Line connects the airport to downtown, and the Expo Line stops at the stadium.

Buses and SeaBus: The transit system is comprehensive. You can get to the stadium from almost anywhere.

Driving: There's parking downtown, but it's expensive and traffic can be frustrating. Skip the car if you can.

Rideshare: Uber and Lyft work in Vancouver. Easy for getting around.

From the airport: YVR to downtown is about 25-30 minutes on the Canada Line SkyTrain. It's direct, cheap, and efficient. One of the best airport connections in North America.

Pro tip: The Canada Line from YVR drops you downtown, then you can walk or take one stop on the Expo Line to the stadium. Easy.

Arrive early and walk along the False Creek seawall. The views of the mountains and the water are incredible. Grab food at Granville Island before heading to the match.
