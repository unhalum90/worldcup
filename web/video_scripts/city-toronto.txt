[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hey everyone! Welcome to Toronto - Canada's largest city and one of the most multicultural cities in the world.

Toronto is bringing serious soccer passion to this World Cup. Toronto FC has built a strong supporter culture, and the city itself? Over half the population was born outside Canada. This place knows international football.

BMO Field has a beautiful waterfront location at Exhibition Place. It's intimate compared to some mega-stadiums, but the atmosphere will be incredible.

Let's explore what Toronto has to offer."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you should know about Toronto:

DIVERSITY IS THE VIBE. Toronto is genuinely one of the most multicultural cities on Earth. Little Italy, Chinatown, Little India, Koreatown, Greektown - the food scene reflects this. Whatever cuisine you want, Toronto has it, and it's authentic.

Weather in June and July is great - mid-70s, comfortable humidity. Perfect football weather. Occasionally hot spells push it into the 80s.

For Americans: remember you're in CANADA. You need a passport. Canadian dollars are the currency (though some places accept USD). And yes, people are genuinely friendly - the stereotype is real.

One thing to watch: Toronto can be expensive. It's not NYC expensive, but it's not cheap either. Hotels and restaurants in tourist areas add up."

[LODGING SECTION]

"Lodging in Toronto:

Downtown / Financial District: Lots of hotels, central location, easy transit everywhere. Close to Union Station which connects to the stadium.

Entertainment District / King West: Great for nightlife. Tons of bars and restaurants. Walking distance to the waterfront and stadium.

Queen West: Trendy area with boutique hotels and great character. A bit further from the stadium but fun neighborhood.

Waterfront / Harbourfront: Some hotel options right on the lake. Beautiful views and close to BMO Field.

Liberty Village: Near Exhibition Place. Developing area with some accommodations close to the stadium.

Yorkville: Upscale area if you want luxury.

Toronto has lots of Airbnb and vacation rental options. These can be good value, especially for groups.

Book early - Toronto summers are busy, and World Cup demand will be high."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to BMO Field:

Streetcar: The 509 and 511 streetcars run from Union Station along the waterfront to Exhibition Place. This is easy and scenic. The stadium is a short walk from the Exhibition Loop.

GO Train: Exhibition GO Station is right at Exhibition Place. Regional trains connect here on event days.

Walking: If you're staying in the Entertainment District or waterfront area, you might be able to walk. It's about 30-40 minutes from King West.

Driving: There's parking at Exhibition Place, but it fills up. Lakeshore Boulevard can get congested on event days.

Rideshare: Uber works great in Toronto. Prices are reasonable. Drop off near Exhibition Place and walk in.

From the airport: YYZ to downtown is about 30-45 minutes. The UP Express train runs from Pearson to Union Station in 25 minutes - fast and reliable. Uber works too but costs more.

Pro tip: Take the UP Express from Pearson to Union Station, then grab the streetcar to Exhibition. It's the smoothest route from the airport to the stadium area.

The waterfront around Exhibition Place is beautiful. Arrive early, walk along the lake, grab food at one of the patios, and enjoy the pre-match atmosphere.
