[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Looking at the map, Arrowhead Stadium is part of the Truman Sports Complex, east of downtown Kansas City.

Key areas to know:
- Downtown KC and the Power & Light District are where the nightlife and entertainment are
- The Crossroads Arts District is the trendy, artsy neighborhood
- Country Club Plaza is upscale shopping and dining with beautiful Spanish architecture
- Westport has great bars and restaurants
- Kansas City International Airport (MCI) is about 25 minutes northwest

One thing to note: Kansas City straddles two states - Kansas and Missouri. The stadium and most attractions are on the Missouri side."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you should know about Kansas City:

The BBQ is legendary, and you NEED to try it. Gates, Joe's Kansas City, Q39, Arthur Bryant's - these are institutions. Seriously, budget time for BBQ research.

Weather-wise, June in KC is warm - mid-80s typically - but it can get hot. The stadium is outdoors with no roof, so you'll feel the weather.

Also, Kansas City is in Tornado Alley. Summer storms can be dramatic with impressive lightning shows. Keep an eye on the weather and know that the stadium has safety protocols for severe weather."

[LODGING SECTION]

"For lodging in KC:

Downtown and Power & Light: This is the entertainment hub with easy access to bars, restaurants, and nightlife. Great if you want to be in the action.

Country Club Plaza: Beautiful area with a more upscale feel. Lots of shops and good restaurants. A bit further from downtown nightlife.

Near the stadium: There are some hotels closer to the Truman Sports Complex, but honestly, the area around the stadium is mostly parking lots. Stay downtown for a better experience.

Westport: Good mid-range option with local character and plenty of bars.

KC is very affordable compared to coastal cities. Your dollar stretches further here on hotels, food, and entertainment."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to Arrowhead Stadium:

Here's the reality - Kansas City is a car city. Public transit options to the stadium are limited.

Driving: The Truman Sports Complex has massive parking lots. Tailgating is a HUGE tradition at Arrowhead - Chiefs fans are legendary for their pre-game setups. Arrive early, bring a grill, make friends.

Rideshare: Uber and Lyft work, but be prepared for surge pricing after events. Set a clear pickup point away from the main exits to avoid chaos.

Shuttles: Some hotels and bars organize shuttles to games. Check with your hotel or look for organized fan shuttles closer to the tournament.

From the airport: MCI to downtown is about 25 minutes, then you'll need to get to the stadium from there. No direct transit connection.

Pro tip: Tailgating at Arrowhead is not optional - it's part of the experience. Even if you take a rideshare to the game, plan to arrive early and walk through the lots. The atmosphere is incredible.

That's Kansas City! Full guide at worldcup26fanzone.com. Get ready for some BBQ and some soccer!"
