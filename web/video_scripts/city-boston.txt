[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hey everyone! Welcome to Boston - well, technically Foxborough - one of the 16 host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Now, here's the thing about Boston as a World Cup host: Gillette Stadium isn't IN Boston. It's in Foxborough, about 30 miles south of the city. This is going to shape your entire planning strategy.

Let's break down how to make this work."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Looking at the map, you can see the stadium is way down here in Foxborough, while Boston is up here.

Key areas to know:
- Downtown Boston and Back Bay have most of the hotels and nightlife
- Fenway area is great for sports bars and has that Boston atmosphere
- Logan Airport is right on Boston Harbor, easy access to downtown
- Patriot Place surrounds the stadium - it's a shopping and entertainment complex

The distance between Boston and the stadium is THE planning challenge here. You need to think about this for every decision."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's the ONE thing you absolutely must understand about Boston:

The stadium is NOT in the city, and getting there and back is a logistical challenge.

There's no regular public transit to Foxborough. The MBTA runs special event trains from South Station, but they sell out fast and run on a limited schedule.

If you miss the last train back, you're looking at $100+ for a rideshare during surge pricing.

Plan your transport BEFORE you book anything else. Seriously - this is the most important decision you'll make for your Boston World Cup experience."

[LODGING SECTION]

"For lodging, you have two main strategies:

Strategy 1: Stay in Boston. You get all the nightlife, restaurants, and atmosphere of the city. But you'll need to solve the transport puzzle for match days.

Strategy 2: Stay near the stadium. There are hotels in Foxborough and nearby towns like Providence. You can walk to the stadium, but you'll miss the Boston experience.

My take? If you're there for multiple days, stay in Boston and enjoy the city. If you're just flying in for one match, consider staying closer to minimize transport headaches.

Whatever you choose, book early. Boston hotels are expensive and World Cup demand will be intense."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Alright, transport - this is the big one for Boston.

Option 1: MBTA Event Trains. They run from South Station and sometimes Providence. Get the mTicket app, buy round-trip tickets THE MOMENT they become available. These sell out.

Option 2: Drive and park. On-site parking is about $50 prepaid, but the traffic getting out is brutal - expect 1-2 hours sitting in your car after the match. Some locals prefer private off-site lots about a mile away for a faster escape.

Option 3: Rideshare. Works for getting there, but after the match? Surge pricing hits hard. We're talking $100-150 to get back to Boston.

Option 4: Organized shuttles or Rally Bus services. Look into these - they can be a good middle ground.

Pro tip from locals: If you drive, either park far away and walk, or plan to hang out at Patriot Place for an hour after the match until traffic clears.
