[INTRO - Hero Section]

"What's up everyone! Welcome to Miami - sun, sand, and SOCCER.

Miami is one of the most international cities in the United States. You'll hear Spanish, Portuguese, French, and dozens of other languages on the streets. For a World Cup, that's perfect.

Hard Rock Stadium has hosted Super Bowls, WrestleMania, Formula 1, and now it gets to host the World Cup.

Let's check out what Miami has to offer."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Miami geography 101:

Hard Rock Stadium is in Miami Gardens, which is north of downtown Miami proper.

Key areas to know:
- South Beach: The iconic beach scene with Art Deco architecture, Ocean Drive, clubs, restaurants. This is what most people picture when they think 'Miami.'
- Downtown Miami / Brickell: Modern high-rises, business district, growing nightlife and restaurant scene
- Wynwood: The arts district with incredible murals, breweries, and galleries
- Little Havana: Cuban culture, Calle Ocho, amazing coffee and food
- Coral Gables: Upscale, historic, beautiful architecture
- Fort Lauderdale: Further north, has its own airport (FLL) and beach scene
- Miami International Airport (MIA): West of downtown

The stadium is about 30 minutes north of South Beach without traffic. With traffic? Could be an hour or more."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you should know about Miami:

HEAT AND HUMIDITY. June and July in Miami are HOT - low 90s Fahrenheit with high humidity. It feels even hotter. You will sweat. A lot.

Hard Rock Stadium does have a partial canopy that provides shade, but you're still in subtropical weather. Hydrate constantly. Wear sunscreen. Take breaks in air conditioning.

Also - this is hurricane season. Miami doesn't get hit every year, but tropical weather is possible. Keep an eye on forecasts as your trip approaches.

On the positive side: Miami's nightlife is legendary. The beach is beautiful. The Cuban coffee is incredible. The food scene - especially Latin American cuisine - is outstanding. And the multicultural vibe means World Cup fans will feel right at home."

[LODGING SECTION]

"Lodging in Miami:

South Beach: If you want the classic Miami experience - beach, nightlife, Art Deco - this is it. You'll pay more, but it's iconic. Ocean Drive is touristy but fun.

Downtown / Brickell: More of an urban vibe. Good hotels, rooftop bars, modern feel. Closer to the stadium than South Beach.

Wynwood: Artsy, trendy, good restaurants and bars. Fewer hotels but some great boutique options.

Miami Gardens / Near Stadium: There are hotels closer to Hard Rock Stadium. Not as exciting, but convenient for match days.

Fort Lauderdale: Consider this! It's about 30 miles north of Miami but has a beach, is often cheaper, and some visitors prefer the slightly more relaxed vibe. Plus, FLL airport is there.

Miami is expensive, especially in summer tourist season. Book early. Expect South Beach hotels to be pricey."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to Hard Rock Stadium:

Rideshare: Uber and Lyft are widely used in Miami. Expect surge pricing on match days. Plan for a designated pickup spot after the game - the parking lots get chaotic.

Driving: The stadium has parking, but traffic on I-95 and surrounding roads can be brutal. Tailgating exists but isn't as huge as some other venues.

Public Transit: Miami's public transit isn't great, honestly. There's Metrorail, but it doesn't go directly to the stadium. Buses can work but are slow.

Express Shuttles: Look for organized shuttles from South Beach and downtown on match days. This could be your best bet to avoid driving and surge pricing.

From the airport: MIA to South Beach is about 30-45 minutes. To the stadium is similar. MIA has good taxi and rideshare infrastructure.

Pro tip: Get to the stadium EARLY to beat traffic. The area around Hard Rock Stadium gets congested. Leaving early gives you time to explore, grab food, and not stress about kickoff.

That's Miami! Full guide at worldcup26fanzone.com. Get ready for palm trees, beach days, and world-class soccer!"
