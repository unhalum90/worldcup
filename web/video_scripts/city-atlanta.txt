[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hey everyone! Welcome to Atlanta, one of the 16 host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium is one of the most impressive venues in North America - that retractable roof and the famous 360-degree halo board are absolutely incredible.

Let's walk through everything you need to know to make your Atlanta World Cup experience unforgettable."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Looking at the map, you can see Mercedes-Benz Stadium sits right in the heart of downtown Atlanta, next to the Georgia World Congress Center.

Key areas to know:
- Downtown is where the stadium is, along with Centennial Olympic Park - great for fan gatherings
- Midtown is just north, with great restaurants and nightlife along Peachtree Street
- Buckhead is the upscale district, further north
- The airport, Hartsfield-Jackson, is about 15 minutes south via MARTA rail

The stadium's central location makes it one of the most transit-friendly venues in the tournament."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's the one thing you NEED to know about Atlanta:

It gets HOT. Like, really hot in June.

Expect temperatures in the high 80s to low 90s Fahrenheit with serious humidity. The good news? Mercedes-Benz has that retractable roof and air conditioning. But outside, you'll want to stay hydrated and take breaks in air-conditioned spaces.

Also, Atlanta is known for unpredictable summer afternoon thunderstorms - they roll in fast and hard, then clear up. Pack a light rain jacket."

[LODGING SECTION]

"For lodging, you've got great options at every price point.

If you want to walk to the stadium, look at Downtown hotels near Centennial Park - there are several chains within a 10-minute walk.

For more nightlife and dining options, Midtown along Peachtree is fantastic - still just a quick MARTA ride or rideshare to the stadium.

Budget travelers should look at hotels near MARTA stations in Buckhead or along the airport line - the train goes straight to the stadium area.

Pro tip: Book early! Atlanta hosts tons of conventions, and World Cup demand will be massive."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to the game - Atlanta actually makes this pretty easy.

MARTA rail is your best friend here. The Vine City or GWCC/CNN Center stations are both walking distance to the stadium. A one-way fare is just a few bucks and you skip all the traffic.

If you're driving, parking downtown gets expensive fast - $30-50+ on event days. There are some cheaper lots further out if you're willing to walk.

Rideshare works well here but expect surge pricing after the match. Set your pickup point away from the stadium - maybe near Centennial Park - to avoid the crush.

My recommendation? Take MARTA. It's clean, safe, and drops you right at the stadium. Can't beat it.

That's Atlanta! For the full guide with links, fan meetup spots, and more, check out worldcup26fanzone.com. See you at the match!"
