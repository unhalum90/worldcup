[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hola amigos! Welcome to Monterrey, the industrial powerhouse of Mexico and our second Mexican host city.

Now, Monterrey might not be as famous as Mexico City or Cancún, but this city is going to surprise you. It's modern, it's wealthy, it's surrounded by dramatic mountains, and the soccer culture here is INTENSE.

Estadio BBVA is one of the most impressive modern stadiums in the Americas - opened in 2015 with stunning architecture.

Let's explore what Monterrey has in store."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Monterrey geography:

The city sits in a valley surrounded by the Sierra Madre mountains. That backdrop is stunning - Cerro de la Silla, the saddle-shaped mountain, is iconic.

Estadio BBVA is actually in Guadalupe, a suburb east of downtown Monterrey.

Key areas to know:
- Centro / Macroplaza: The historic downtown with one of the largest plazas in the world
- Barrio Antiguo: The old quarter - bars, restaurants, nightlife, colonial buildings
- San Pedro Garza García: Upscale area south of downtown, lots of modern restaurants and malls
- Fundidora Park: Former steel factory turned massive urban park with museums
- Monterrey International Airport (MTY): Northeast of the city, about 30 minutes to downtown

The city is spread out and car-oriented, but central areas are manageable."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you should know about Monterrey:

It's HOT. Like, seriously hot. June temperatures regularly hit the upper 90s to 100+ Fahrenheit. The dry heat is intense. This isn't the coastal humidity of Miami - it's desert heat.

Stay hydrated. Plan indoor, air-conditioned activities during the hottest part of the day. Evening and night are much more pleasant.

Also, Monterrey is an industrial and business city - it's Mexico's economic engine. The vibe is different from tourist Mexico. But the food is incredible (especially cabrito - roasted goat), the people are warm, and the soccer passion is real.

C.F. Monterrey and Tigres UANL are both huge clubs here. This is a two-team city with intense rivalry. The fans know their soccer."

[LODGING SECTION]

"For lodging in Monterrey:

Centro / Barrio Antiguo: Stay here for walkability and nightlife. The historic area has character, good restaurants, and bars. You'll be close to Macroplaza and the cultural attractions.

San Pedro Garza García: The upscale suburb with modern hotels, nice restaurants, and shopping centers. A bit sterile but comfortable.

Near the stadium: There are some hotels in the Guadalupe area closer to BBVA Stadium. Not much to do nearby, but convenient for match days.

Fundidora area: Near the big urban park. Good option if you want green space and cultural attractions.

Monterrey is affordable compared to US cities. Hotels, food, and transport won't break the bank. Uber works great here.

Book hotels with good AC. You'll want to retreat to cool air during the heat of the day."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to Estadio BBVA:

Uber: This is your easiest option. Uber is widely used in Monterrey and affordable. On match days, expect some surge pricing and traffic.

Metro: Monterrey has a metro system. Line 2 can get you close to the stadium area, but you'll still need to walk or grab a short Uber from the station.

Driving: Possible, but parking around the stadium gets crowded. Traffic in Monterrey is improving but match day congestion is real.

From the airport: MTY airport to downtown is about 30 minutes. Easy Uber ride.

Pro tip: Estadio BBVA is beautiful but exposed to the elements. If you have a day match, bring sun protection. The stadium has some shade from the roof structure, but the Mexican sun is no joke.

Also, arrive early to appreciate the architecture. This stadium is genuinely impressive - one of the best in North America.

That's Monterrey! Full guide at worldcup26fanzone.com. Get ready for mountains, heat, and passionate Mexican soccer fans!"
