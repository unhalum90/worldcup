[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hey everyone! Welcome to Seattle - the Emerald City and one of America's best soccer cities.

Seattle is special. The Sounders routinely sell out matches with 40,000+ fans creating one of the best atmospheres in MLS. The supporters' culture here is REAL.

Lumen Field sits right in the heart of the city, with views of the downtown skyline. It's going to be electric for the World Cup.

Plus, Seattle offers incredible food, coffee culture (obviously), stunning natural beauty, and a city that's easy to navigate.

Let's dive in."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Seattle geography:

Lumen Field is in the SoDo district (South of Downtown), right next to T-Mobile Park where the Mariners play.

Key areas to know:
- Downtown: The urban core - Pike Place Market, the waterfront, shopping
- Capitol Hill: The hip neighborhood - bars, restaurants, nightlife, LGBTQ+ friendly
- Pioneer Square: Historic neighborhood right near the stadium, great pre-game area
- Belltown: Downtown adjacent, lots of restaurants and bars
- Fremont and Ballard: Quirky neighborhoods north of downtown with breweries and character
- Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA): About 15 miles south of downtown

The stadium is very accessible - you can walk from downtown in 15-20 minutes."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you should know about Seattle:

The weather reputation is misleading. Yes, Seattle is known for rain, but June and July are actually the DRY months. Summer in Seattle is gorgeous - mid-60s to mid-70s, often sunny, low humidity. It's one of the best times to visit.

Pack layers though. Mornings and evenings can be cool, especially near the water.

Seattle's coffee culture is real. This is where Starbucks started, but skip the chains and hit the local roasters - Victrola, Elm Coffee, Milstead. 

The food scene is fantastic, especially seafood. Pike Place Market is touristy but still worth visiting. The fish throwing is iconic.

And the soccer culture - I can't emphasize this enough. Sounders fans are loud, organized, and passionate. The atmosphere at Lumen Field is one of the best you'll experience."

[LODGING SECTION]

"Lodging in Seattle:

Downtown: The most convenient option. Walk to Pike Place Market, walk to the stadium, walk to restaurants. Lots of hotel options from budget to luxury.

Capitol Hill: If you want nightlife and a younger vibe. Great restaurants and bars, easy transit to downtown and the stadium.

Pioneer Square: Historic neighborhood right next to the stadium. Some boutique hotels, good for pre-game atmosphere.

Belltown: Downtown-adjacent with good dining options. Walking distance to everything.

South Lake Union: Amazon headquarters area. Modern, some hotels, a bit corporate but convenient.

Seattle isn't cheap, but it's more affordable than SF or NYC. Book early - summer is peak season and World Cup demand will spike prices.

Pro tip: You don't need a car in Seattle. The city is walkable and transit works. Save money by skipping the rental."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to Lumen Field:

Walking: If you're staying downtown, you can literally walk to the stadium in 15-20 minutes. This is ideal.

Light Rail: The Link Light Rail has a Stadium station right at Lumen Field. It connects to the airport, downtown, Capitol Hill, and the University District. This is easy and cheap.

Buses: Seattle's bus system is solid and many routes pass near the stadium.

Driving: There's parking, but it's expensive and downtown Seattle traffic isn't fun. Skip it if you can.

Rideshare: Uber and Lyft work well. The stadium area has designated pickup/dropoff areas.

From the airport: SEA to downtown is about 40 minutes on the Link Light Rail - direct, easy, cheap. This is one of the best airport-to-downtown connections in the US.

Pro tip: Take the Link Light Rail from the airport directly to downtown or even to the Stadium station. It's simple and affordable. Post-game, trains will be packed but running frequently.

The Pioneer Square area near the stadium has great bars for pre and post-game. Plan to hang out before the match and soak in the atmosphere.
