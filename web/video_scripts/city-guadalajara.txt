[INTRO - Hero Section]

"¡Hola amigos! Welcome to Guadalajara, one of the three Mexican host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Guadalajara is Mexico's second-largest city and the heart of Jalisco state - this is the birthplace of mariachi music and tequila. The culture here is incredible.

Estadio Akron is home to Chivas, one of Mexico's most beloved clubs. Let's explore this amazing city."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Looking at the map, Estadio Akron is located in Zapopan, on the northwest edge of the Guadalajara metro area.

Key areas:
- Centro Histórico is the historic downtown with beautiful colonial architecture
- Zona Centro has the main cathedral and Plaza de Armas
- Tlaquepaque is the artisan district - amazing crafts and galleries
- Chapultepec is the trendy nightlife area
- The airport, Miguel Hidalgo International, is about 20 minutes south

The stadium is a bit outside the city center, so you'll need to plan your transport."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you need to know about Guadalajara:

This is tequila country, and the hospitality is incredible - but the altitude and heat can sneak up on you.

Guadalajara sits at about 5,100 feet elevation. Not as extreme as Mexico City, but if you're coming from sea level, take it easy the first day. Add in June temperatures in the mid-80s Fahrenheit, and dehydration is real.

Drink plenty of water - especially if you're also enjoying the local tequila. Pace yourself, and you'll have an amazing time."

[LODGING SECTION]

"For lodging in Guadalajara:

Centro Histórico gives you that classic Mexican experience - beautiful colonial buildings, walkable to restaurants and culture. Just know you'll need transport to the stadium.

Zona Chapultepec is the modern, trendy district with great nightlife. Popular with younger travelers.

Near the stadium in Zapopan, there are modern hotels if you want to minimize match-day travel. You'll miss some of the downtown charm but gain convenience.

Guadalajara is generally very affordable compared to US cities. Your money goes further here on hotels, food, and transportation.

Pro tip: Consider staying an extra day or two to visit Tequila, the actual town where tequila comes from. It's about an hour away and absolutely worth the trip."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to Estadio Akron:

Uber and DiDi are widely used in Guadalajara and are the easiest option. Prices are very reasonable by US standards. Just allow extra time on match days for traffic.

Driving is possible, but traffic in Guadalajara can be intense, and stadium parking logistics vary. If you're not familiar with Mexican driving, rideshare is less stressful.

Public buses serve the area but can be confusing for visitors. The Macrobús rapid transit system serves some routes but doesn't go directly to the stadium.

Special event shuttles will likely be organized - check closer to the tournament for World Cup specific transport.

Taxis are available but negotiate the price upfront or make sure they use the meter. Official site taxis (taxi de sitio) are generally safer than street hails.

One more thing - Mexican fans know how to party before and after games. The atmosphere around the stadium will be incredible. Soak it in.
