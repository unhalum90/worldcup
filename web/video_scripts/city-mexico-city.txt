[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hola, everyone! Welcome to Mexico City, and welcome to HISTORY.

Estadio Azteca is legendary. It's the only stadium in the world that will have hosted THREE FIFA World Cup tournaments - 1970, 1986, and now 2026.

This is where Maradona's 'Hand of God' happened. This is where Pelé lifted the trophy. And on June 11th, 2026, this is where the World Cup BEGINS with the opening match.

Mexico City is massive, it's vibrant, it's affordable, and it's going to be absolutely electric.

Let's explore."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world, so geography matters:

Estadio Azteca is in the south of the city, in the Coyoacán area.

Key neighborhoods to know:
- Centro Histórico: The colonial heart of the city - Zócalo, the cathedral, historic buildings everywhere
- Roma and Condesa: The hip, trendy neighborhoods. Great restaurants, cafes, tree-lined streets. Very walkable and popular with visitors
- Polanco: Upscale area with luxury hotels, restaurants, and shopping
- Coyoacán: Near the stadium, charming area with the Frida Kahlo museum
- Santa Fe: Business district, modern, lots of hotels
- Benito Juárez International Airport (MEX): East side of the city

The metro system here is EXCELLENT and incredibly cheap. Learn it, use it, love it."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's what you need to know about Mexico City:

ALTITUDE. Mexico City sits at 2,240 meters - about 7,350 feet above sea level. That's higher than Denver.

You will feel it, especially the first day or two. Some people get mild altitude sickness - headaches, shortness of breath when walking uphill, fatigue. Stay hydrated. Take it easy on day one.

The good news? By day two or three, most people adjust. Just be aware of it.

Other things: Mexico City's food scene is INCREDIBLE and cheap. Tacos, tlacoyos, tortas, mole - the flavors here are next level. Street food is generally safe in busy areas.

The city is safer than its reputation suggests, but use common sense. The tourist areas - Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Centro - are well-policed and full of visitors."

[LODGING SECTION]

"For lodging in Mexico City:

Roma / Condesa: This is where most visitors want to stay. Beautiful neighborhoods, walkable, amazing restaurants and bars. Tons of boutique hotels and Airbnbs. Highly recommended.

Polanco: More upscale and business-like. Big name hotels, luxury shopping. A bit quieter at night.

Centro Histórico: Stay here if you want to be immersed in history. More chaotic but incredibly atmospheric. Budget-friendly options.

Near Estadio Azteca / Coyoacán: You could stay here to be close to the stadium. It's a charming area with the Frida Kahlo house, but it's further from nightlife.

Here's the beautiful thing: Mexico City is AFFORDABLE. Your money goes far here. A nice hotel in Roma might cost what a budget hotel costs in New York. Amazing meals for $10-15. Cheap Ubers.

Exchange some pesos at an ATM when you arrive - it's the easiest way."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to Estadio Azteca:

Metro: The Metro is your friend. Take Line 2 to Tasqueña, then the Tren Ligero light rail to the Estadio Azteca station. It's cheap, efficient, and avoids traffic.

Uber: Very popular in Mexico City and affordable. But on match days, traffic around the stadium could be challenging. Consider getting dropped off a bit further away and walking.

Driving: Possible, but traffic in CDMX is legendary. Parking around the stadium is limited and chaotic.

From the airport: MEX airport to Roma/Condesa takes about 30-60 minutes depending on traffic. Much longer during rush hour. Uber works from the airport, or use authorized taxis.

Pro tip: The atmosphere AROUND Estadio Azteca on match days is incredible. Plan to arrive early, soak in the energy, grab some street food from the vendors, and experience the passion of Mexican fans.
