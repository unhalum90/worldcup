[INTRO - Hero Section]

"Hey everyone! Welcome to Houston, one of the 16 host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Houston is America's fourth-largest city, incredibly diverse, and absolutely passionate about soccer. NRG Stadium has hosted Super Bowls, Final Fours, and some epic concerts. The atmosphere is going to be electric.

Let's dive into everything you need to know about H-Town."

[MAP & KEY LOCATIONS]

"Looking at the map, NRG Stadium is part of the NRG Park complex, just southwest of downtown Houston.

Key areas:
- Downtown Houston has the theaters, Discovery Green park, and plenty of hotels
- Midtown and Montrose are the hip, walkable neighborhoods with great food and nightlife
- The Galleria area is upscale shopping and hotels
- The Museum District is world-class and worth a visit
- Both airports - Bush Intercontinental (IAH) and Hobby (HOU) - serve the city

The stadium is actually pretty accessible from most parts of the city, usually 15-30 minutes depending on traffic."

[ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND]

"Here's the deal with Houston in June:

It's going to be HOT and HUMID. We're talking low 90s Fahrenheit with humidity that makes it feel over 100.

NRG Stadium has a retractable roof and excellent AC, so inside you'll be comfortable. But outside? The heat is serious.

Stay hydrated, take breaks in air conditioning, and don't underestimate the sun. If you're tailgating, find shade and bring lots of water.

Also, Houston gets sudden summer thunderstorms - they're brief but intense. The indoor stadium means the match will go on, but your pre-game plans might need flexibility."

[LODGING SECTION]

"Houston has tons of lodging options:

Near NRG Park: There are several hotels within a couple miles of the stadium. Convenient for match day but not the most exciting area otherwise.

Downtown: Great central location with easy access to restaurants, bars, and the light rail. You can take the train right to the stadium.

Midtown/Montrose: This is where the locals hang out. Great food scene, walkable streets, and more character than the chain hotel areas.

Galleria: If you want upscale shopping and dining, this area has nice hotels, though it's further from the stadium.

Houston hotels are generally reasonable, and you'll find good deals compared to coastal cities. The city is spread out, so being near a METRORail station is a plus."

[TRANSPORT TO THE GAME]

"Getting to NRG Stadium - Houston actually gives you good options:

METRORail: This is your best bet. The Red Line runs from downtown straight to NRG Park. It's cheap, avoids traffic, and drops you right at the stadium. Trains run frequently on event days.

Driving: There's extensive parking at NRG Park, typically $20-40 depending on the lot and how close you want to be. Houston traffic is what it is - give yourself plenty of time.

Rideshare: Uber and Lyft work well. Designated pickup areas help with the post-match chaos. Expect some surge pricing but it's manageable.

From the airports: Bush (IAH) is about 45 minutes north, Hobby (HOU) is closer at about 20 minutes. Both connect to the METRORail system with some transfers.

Pro tip: Houston's tailgating culture is legit. NRG Park has huge lots where fans set up elaborate setups. Arrive early, make some friends, enjoy the pre-game atmosphere.

That's Houston! Complete guide at worldcup26fanzone.com. See you at NRG!"
