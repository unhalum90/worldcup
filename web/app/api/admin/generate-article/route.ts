Create a comprehensive article outline for: "${topic}"${cityContext}

CRITICAL CONTEXT - World Cup 2026 Geographic Complexities:
Many host cities present unique lodging challenges that casual fans overlook:
   - Stadiums like Dallas, Miami, Kansas City are in suburbs/industrial areas
   - No metro lines = you're stuck without a car
   - Fan Festivals are often downtown, miles away from stadiums
   - Limited restaurants/nightlife near suburban stadiums
   - Hotel rates surge 300-500% near stadiums

2. PRESENT STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES: Don't just list hotels - explain the TRADEOFFS:
   - "Stay downtown near Fan Festival vs. near stadium" - which makes sense when?
   - "Rent a car vs. rely on Uber" - costs, convenience, parking realities
   - "Transit-accessible neighborhoods" - be specific about routes, times, costs
   - "Alternative cities" - for multi-match attendees, staying in nearby cities can save thousands
   - Each option should have a CREATIVE TITLE like "The Counter-Intuitive Choice" or "The Smart Value Play"

3. SHOW LOCAL EXPERTISE: Include insider details that prove you know the city:
   - Specific neighborhoods with character descriptions
   - Transit line names, costs, and frequency
   - Traffic patterns on game days
   - Airport proximity and preferences (e.g., "Hobby vs. IAH")
   - Where locals actually go vs. tourist traps
   - Specific hotel/area names as examples
   - Use local terminology and references

4. STRUCTURE EACH LODGING OPTION:
   - Creative section title (e.g., "The Savvy Traveler's Secret: Stay on the METRORail Red Line")
   - WHY this strategy works (opening paragraph)
   - Insider hack or tip (specific, actionable)
   - Specific neighborhoods/areas with bullet points:
     * Neighborhood name + vibe description
     * Commute to Stadium: [specific time/method]
     * Why stay here: [specific advantages]
   - Closing thought on who this is best for

Requirements:
- Use Markdown formatting (headings, lists, bold, italics)
- 1200-1800 words minimum
- Confident, problem-solving tone - you're the expert cutting through the confusion
- Include specific data: distances, transit times, costs, neighborhood names
- Use comparison tables where helpful (transit options, neighborhood pros/cons)
- Incorporate SEO keywords naturally: "${topic}"${cityContext}
- Strong hook that challenges conventional wisdom (e.g., "hotel rates surge 400%")
- Use H2 (##) for main lodging strategies, H3 (###) for subsections if needed
- Add horizontal rules (---) between major sections for visual separation
- DO NOT write a conclusion section - it will be added automatically

Your content MUST address these complexities and present strategic alternatives.

Requirements:
- Target audience: Soccer fans planning trips to World Cup 2026 who need strategic lodging advice
- SEO-focused with informational and practical value
- Emphasize the geographic/transit realities that make lodging choices complex
- Include introduction, 3-5 main sections with strategic lodging options, and practical comparisons
- Address stadium location, Fan Festival location, transit options (or lack thereof)
- Provide specific neighborhood recommendations with pros/cons
- Include insider tips that show deep local knowledge${referenceContext}

REFERENCE EXAMPLE - Match This Quality & Detail Level:
Here's an example of the tone, depth, and strategic thinking we expect:

"For World Cup travel in Houston, direct access to the METRORail Red Line is strategically more valuable than walking distance to the stadium. Fan experiences confirm that the train is the most recommended way to get to NRG Park, allowing you to bypass what locals describe as 'horrendous' traffic and congested, expensive parking. At just $1.25 for a one-way trip, it's an unbeatable value.

Here's the ultimate insider tip for leaving the match: to avoid the packed northbound trains, take the southbound train one stop to the Fannin South Park & Ride. Then, simply cross the platform and board the now-empty northbound train for a comfortable ride back to your neighborhood."

Notice:
- Specific transit line name (METRORail Red Line)
- Exact cost ($1.25)
- Real fan feedback ("horrendous" traffic)
- Insider hack that shows deep local knowledge (southbound trick)
- Confident, problem-solving tone

CRITICAL TONE & MESSAGING:
This is NOT generic travel advice. Your key differentiator is addressing the COMPLEXITY of World Cup lodging decisions:

1. CALL OUT THE PROBLEM: Most fans assume "book near stadium" is smart, but:
   - Stadiums like Dallas, Miami, Kansas City are in suburbs/industrial areas
   - No metro lines = you're stuck without a car
   - Fan Festivals are often downtown, miles away from stadiums
   - Limited restaurants/nightlife near suburban stadiums

2. PRESENT STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES: Don't just list hotels - explain the TRADEOFFS:
   - "Stay downtown near Fan Festival vs. near stadium" - which makes sense when?
   - "Rent a car vs. rely on Uber" - costs, convenience, parking realities
   - "Transit-accessible neighborhoods" - be specific about routes, times, costs
   - "Alternative cities" - for multi-match attendees, staying in nearby cities can save thousands

3. SHOW LOCAL EXPERTISE: Include insider details that prove you know the city:
   - Specific neighborhoods with character descriptions
   - Transit line names, costs, and frequency
   - Traffic patterns on game days
   - Where locals actually go vs. tourist traps

Requirements:
- Use Markdown formatting (headings, lists, bold, italics)
- 1200-1800 words
- Confident, problem-solving tone - you're the expert cutting through the confusion
- Include specific data: distances, transit times, neighborhood names
- Use comparison tables where helpful (transit options, neighborhood pros/cons)
