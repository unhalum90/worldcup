## Group B Overview

Group B of the 2026 World Cup features co-host **Canada** and three yet-to-be-determined opponents. This group presents the most challenging travel itinerary of the entire tournament, sending fans on a **3,815-mile, coast-to-coast journey** across two nations and five distinct host cities. It combines the urban centers of Canada's largest cities with the iconic metropolises of the US West Coast.

*   🇨🇦 **Canada:** Toronto, Vancouver
*   🇺🇸 **USA:** San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle

**Travel Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very High)

This group's **Very High** complexity rating is due to the combination of three international border crossings, two currencies, and a massive geographic spread that forces fans to travel from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast.

### Challenges:
*   **Three Border Crossings:** Fans following the group will need to navigate the Canada-USA border three times (Canada → USA → Canada → USA).
*   **Dual Currencies:** Managing both Canadian Dollars (CAD) and US Dollars (USD) is essential.
*   **Massive Geographic Spread:** The journey spans nearly 4,000 miles, requiring multiple long-haul flights and significant time zone changes.
*   **"Gap" Cities:** Two of the five host cities, San Francisco (Levi's Stadium) and Los Angeles (SoFi Stadium), have complex or non-existent rail access, making rideshares and shuttles necessary.

### Advantages:
*   **Follow a Host Nation:** Experience the incredible passion of following Canada in their home country.
*   **Excellent Transit in Key Cities:** Toronto, Vancouver, and Seattle all offer excellent public transit or walking access to their stadiums.
*   **Iconic Destinations:** This group offers a bucket-list tour of North America's most famous cities.

## Stadium Transit Access

*   ✅ **Toronto (Toronto Stadium) - EXCELLENT**
    *   Access is straightforward via a 7-minute GO Train ride from Union Station to Exhibition GO.
    *   **Hotel Strategy:** Stay near Union Station or along the GO Train line for the easiest access.

*   ❌ **San Francisco (Bay Area Stadium) - COMPLEX**
    *   The stadium (Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara) requires navigating up to three transit systems (BART + Caltrain + VTA), taking 90-120 minutes from downtown San Francisco.
    *   **Hotel Strategy:** Consider staying in San Jose or Santa Clara to significantly reduce match day travel time.

*   ❌ **Los Angeles (Los Angeles Stadium) - NO RAIL**
    *   The stadium (SoFi Stadium in Inglewood) is in the "Inglewood Gap," approximately 15 miles from downtown, with no direct rail link. Taxis, rideshares, or dedicated shuttles are the only viable options.
    *   **Hotel Strategy:** Stay near the stadium or plan for significant rideshare costs and traffic.

*   ✅ **Vancouver (BC Place) - WALKING**
    *   The stadium is centrally located downtown, offering a 5-15 minute walk from most downtown hotels or direct access via the SkyTrain to the Stadium-Chinatown station.
    *   **Hotel Strategy:** Staying downtown provides the most convenient access.

*   ✅ **Seattle (Seattle Stadium) - WALKING**
    *   The stadium (Lumen Field) is downtown, a short 5-10 minute walk from Pioneer Square or a 2-minute ride on the Link light rail.
    *   **Hotel Strategy:** Downtown Seattle or Pioneer Square offers the best convenience.

## Hub Strategy Analysis

Following Group B is a logistical puzzle due to the coast-to-coast travel and multiple border crossings.

### Option 1: Full Multi-City Trip (The Marathon)
*   **Route:** Toronto → San Francisco → Los Angeles → Vancouver → Seattle
*   **Pros:** Experience all 5 cities, follow your team to every match.
*   **Cons:** 3 border crossings, 5+ hotel bookings, massive travel time, highest overall cost.
*   **Analysis:** Only recommended for the most dedicated and well-funded fans.

### Option 2: West Coast Hub Strategy
*   **Base in Vancouver or Seattle**
*   **Match day logistics:** Fly to Toronto for the first match, then base yourself on the West Coast for the remaining four matches (San Francisco, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Seattle).
*   **Analysis:** Reduces the number of long-haul flights and simplifies the border crossings to one initial entry into the US and one final entry into Canada.

### Option 3: Canada-Only Strategy
*   **Base in Toronto/Vancouver, skip USA matches**
*   **For fans who:** Are following Canada specifically, have visa/budget constraints, or want to avoid US border crossings.
*   **Analysis:** Best for Canadian fans or budget-conscious travelers willing to watch the US matches at a sports bar.
