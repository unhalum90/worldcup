Best (and Worst) of Miami – World Cup 2026

For the thousands of fans descending on Miami for the World Cup, the toughest opponent won't be on the pitch—it will be the grueling journey to Hard Rock Stadium itself.

As Miami prepares to host seven pivotal matches, including the high-stakes Bronze Final, the logistics of fan travel are a primary concern. First, know this: Hard Rock Stadium is located in Miami Gardens, a city north of downtown, meaning the best place to stay may not be Miami at all. But with the right strategy, you can navigate the region like a pro and focus on the beautiful game. Here’s your insider guide to making the most of your trip to the stadium.

The Best of Miami: Pro-Tips for Fans

This is your strategic guide to choosing the right home base and mastering the commute, ensuring your World Cup experience is seamless and memorable.

* Best Value Zone: For the smartest balance of cost and convenience, look no further than Fort Lauderdale or Hollywood. Not only is the commute to the stadium shorter and simpler, but you can also save hundreds of dollars per night on lodging. While rooms in Miami Beach can run from $400 to over $700 per night, hotels here average 250–450, offering incredible value just a straightforward train ride away from the action.
* Best Local Vibe: To immerse yourself in the city's authentic culture, make Little Havana your base. As the beating heart of Miami's Cuban and Latin American heritage, its streets are filled with vibrant music, incredible food, and a genuine local energy that you won't find in the more tourist-centric districts.
* Best Fan Travel Pro-Tip: The single most effective way to get to the match is to take the Brightline train to Aventura Station and use the complimentary shuttle service. This civilized approach lets you completely bypass the nightmare scenario facing unprepared fans who rely on rideshare. They'll be stranded in chaotic lots with terrible cellular service after the match, facing walks of up to two miles just to reach a pickup point and then waiting over an hour for a car.

But knowing where to go is only half the battle. Here's what you absolutely must avoid.

The Worst of Miami: The Honest Truth

Now for a dose of reality. Planning a trip to Miami in June and July means being honest about three things: the oppressive climate, the stadium's transport black hole, and the high costs. The heat and humidity will be extreme, making hydration a critical safety concern. The stadium lacks any direct public transit link, forcing many into the unreliable rideshare system. Relying on rideshare often means a post-match walk of up to two miles just to reach the chaotic pickup lot, where you can expect to wait over an hour for a car—if you can even get a signal to book one. Finally, staying in iconic Miami Beach might seem appealing, but be warned: it comes with the highest price tags and the longest, most complex commute to any of the matches.
