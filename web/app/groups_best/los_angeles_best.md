Los Angeles World Cup 2026: The Fan's Survival Guide (and Teaser)

Los Angeles is ready for the 2026 World Cup with a stadium worthy of a final, but its transportation is stuck in the group stage—and you're the one who will pay the price if you don't plan ahead.

To get your planning started, here's our quick-hit list of the best of LA for the World Cup 2026.

* Best Vibe for Where to Stay: Santa Monica offers a polished, upscale beach scene, while neighboring Venice Beach delivers a more bohemian, artsy vibe.
* Best Value Zone: Anaheim/Orange County offers potentially more affordable lodging options, but be prepared for a longer commute for your fan travel.
* Best Neighborhood Feel: Culver City has that classic LA feel and is conveniently located on the Metro E line, a major public transport artery.
* Fan Pro-Tip: Trust me on this: the only sane way to get to the Los Angeles Stadium is to ditch the car and take the free event shuttles from the LAX/Aviation or Hawthorne Metro stations.

An Honest Warning

Forget the on-field drama; the real knockout stage is the SoFi Stadium parking lot. Driving guarantees a parking fee of up to $100 for the privilege of sitting in an hour of gridlock. Banking on a rideshare? Prepare for a Hunger Games-style scramble with surge pricing that’ll make your eyes water. With the direct rail line to the stadium now officially canceled, your best strategy for the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 is a rock-solid transportation plan.
