## 🧭 Full Narrative Version

> **Because free sites give you information. We help you experience the event.**  
>  
> Most free travel content around major events tells you what’s obvious — where the stadium is, what hotels are nearby, what’s trending on TripAdvisor.  
>  
> But what fans really need isn’t another list — it’s *timing and insight*. Knowing what to book, when to move, and what experiences will quietly disappear while you’re still planning flights.  
>  
> I learned that the hard way. When my wife and I attended the **Paris Olympics in 2024**, we did what most travelers do: booked our flights and lodging months in advance, then stopped thinking about it until the week before the trip.  
>  
> We discovered there was a free “Club France” fan experience — limited to 15,000 tickets a day. We were lucky to snag one night on our first evening in Paris, and it ended up being the **highlight of our entire trip.**  
>  
> The rest of the week? Sold out. We simply hadn’t known about it early enough.  
>  
> That’s exactly why I built World Cup Fan Zone.  
>  
> Our planners don’t just help you find hotels and flights. They *prepare* you — surfacing experiences like Fan Fests, local celebrations, and cultural events *before* they fill up. You get updates as new opportunities appear, and personalized itineraries that blend official World Cup events with the best of each host city.  
>  
> For less than $39, you’re not just buying access to information — you’re buying peace of mind, smarter planning, and the chance to experience moments you’d never even know existed.  
>  
> Free sites give you options. We make sure you don’t miss opportunities.

## ⚡ Condensed Version (for Site FAQ Dropdown)

> **Why do we charge when others are free?**  
>  
> Because information is free — *timing isn’t.*  
>  
> During the Paris Olympics, my wife and I missed out on a free “Club France” fan experience simply because we didn’t know about it until it was too late.  
>  
> World Cup Fan Zone was built to fix that. Our planners help fans get ahead — surfacing events, experiences, and smart travel moves before they sell out.  
>  
> It’s the difference between reading about the World Cup and *living* it.

## 🧭 “Our Story” Narrative Block (for About Page or Marketing Use)

> The idea for World Cup Fan Zone started after we attended the Paris Olympics.  
>  
> We’d done what most travelers do — booked our flights and hotel early and assumed we were set. Then we discovered Club France, a free Olympic fan experience limited to 15,000 people a day.  
>  
> We got lucky and secured one night. It became the highlight of our entire trip. But the rest of the week? Sold out.  
>  
> That was the moment I realized: fans need a system that doesn’t just tell them *where* to go, but *when* and *why*.  
>  
> World Cup Fan Zone exists so no fan misses those once-in-a-lifetime experiences because they found out too late.  
>  
> From early travel planning to daily itineraries during the tournament, our mission is simple — to help every fan experience the World Cup fully, not just attend it.
