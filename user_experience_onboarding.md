# 🧭 User Experience Narrative — Onboarding Flow

The onboarding experience establishes a personal connection between the user and the World Cup Fan Zone ecosystem. It captures key traveler details once and then seamlessly carries them across all tools (Trip Builder, Flight Planner, and Lodging Planner). The goal is to make each planner feel instantly personalized, reducing repetitive input and aligning recommendations to each fan’s goals, travel logistics, and budget realities.

## 1. Experience Overview
When a new member signs up or completes checkout, they are guided into a **three-step onboarding flow**. This process is fast (<45 seconds), visually consistent with the rest of the Fan Zone UI, and focuses on personalization rather than data entry.

Each step is designed to be conversational and intuitive:
1. **Basics:** Capture where the fan is coming from (home airport), group makeup (adults, children, seniors), mobility needs, and ticket ownership.
2. **Style:** Understand travel preferences—budget level, comfort expectations, food and nightlife style, and climate tolerance.
3. **Interests:** Learn what motivates their travel—stadium experiences, fan fests, local culture, or simply the adventure.

A final “You’re All Set” screen confirms success, sets the onboarding cookie, and directs the user to their first planner (Trip Builder or Flight Planner) with data prefilled.

## 2. Value Proposition
The onboarding serves as the foundation for **true personalization**. Rather than generic travel advice, users receive route, lodging, and itinerary recommendations tailored to their circumstances and preferences.

Examples of real-world value:
- A fan staying in Providence instead of downtown Boston can **save hundreds on lodging** and avoid commute chaos.
- A couple from Tokyo attending multiple matches can receive **climate-adjusted packing suggestions** and **optimized intercity flight routes**.
- Families with young children automatically see **family-friendly lodging zones** and match-day logistics that minimize transit stress.

## 3. Early Planning Advantage
Fans who complete onboarding early gain access to evolving trip intelligence as the tournament approaches:
- Priority insights into **Fan Fest and free event access caps** (based on experiences like the 2024 Paris Olympics Club France).
- Updated **transportation and lodging availability alerts** when new data is integrated.
- Dynamic trip adjustments around **official match ticket confirmations** and venue schedules.

## 4. Broader UX Goals
- Reduce friction: all planners prefill data automatically.
- Increase engagement: onboarded members are more likely to explore additional planners and guides.
- Build trust: early users see tangible time and money savings, reinforcing the value of paid membership.
- Global inclusivity: multi-language support ensures smooth onboarding for fans from all continents.

## 5. Developer Handoff Notes
- Maintain UI/UX consistency with the Trip Builder design system (progress bar, cards, soft animations).
- Keep average completion time <45s.
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness—most users will begin onboarding on mobile after checkout.
- Localize copy via `messages/en.json` and `messages/fr.json`.
- Analytics events: track onboarding start, step completion, and onboarding_completed.
- Post-onboarding redirect logic: honor query param `?redirect=` or default to `/planner/trip-builder`.
