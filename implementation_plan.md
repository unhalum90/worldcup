### Key Considerations for a Successful Launch:

*   **Agile Methodology:** Employ an agile development approach to allow for flexibility and rapid iteration within the tight schedule.
*   **Dedicated Team:** A dedicated and experienced development team is crucial to meet the deadlines.
*   **Third-Party Dependencies:** Minimize reliance on complex third-party integrations for the MVP to reduce potential delays.
*   **Content Strategy:** Begin content creation for city guides and fan zone information in parallel with development to ensure readiness for launch.
*   **Pre-Launch Marketing:** Initiate early marketing efforts to build anticipation and a waiting list of users before the official launch.

This schedule is ambitious but achievable with focused effort and clear prioritization of MVP features. Post-launch, continuous development will add more advanced features based on user feedback and evolving World Cup information.
